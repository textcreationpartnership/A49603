            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Alſo remembring how ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable the Labours of the admirable <hi>Du Bartas</hi> were in this Climate, both at Court, and alſo in the City and Country; and looking round the many Writers of the Age, I have ſingled out his Neighbour and Countryman, the venerable Monſieur <hi>L'ARROQUE,</hi> of whom it may be ſaid, in the words of our Saviour, (if Metaphyſical Diſſertations are
<pb facs="tcp:47504:4"/>preferrable before Natural) <hi>That a greater than</hi> Du Bartas <hi>is here:</hi> For he ſang but the Works of the Six Days Creation, which ſhall be deſtroyed and burnt up; but our Author takes a higher flight, and as well from the Records of Heaven, as from the Regiſters of the ſoundeſt Antiquity, diſplays unto us the excellency of that auguſt Sacrament, inſtituted by our Lord himſelf, and which is to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorated in the Church, unto the end of time, that thereby we may be tranſlated into the new <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> there to be everlaſtingly fed and refreſhed with the Fruit of the Tree of Life. As an Angel was ſet at the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> with a fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming Sword; ſo here Entrance is denied un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the prophane Rout, but free Admiſſion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed unto all that are ſincere, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to be ſo, even from the frozen <hi>Lapland<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> unto the ſcorched <hi>Ethiopian,</hi> and from the Chriſtians of <hi>Malabar,</hi> unto thoſe of <hi>Mexico.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I cannot omit informing your Honour, that not many years paſt, with my eyes I beheld the venerable Author of the following Treatiſe,
<pb facs="tcp:47504:5"/>weeping and praying in his Church at <hi>Vitry,</hi> for its preſervation, then in danger of being ſuppreſſed and demoliſhed by reſtleſs Enemies, who effected their wicked deſign ſoon after; and 'tis ſuppoſed, with the greater facility, by reaſon of the Coldneſs and Apoſtaſy of the Lord Proprietor of the place, whoſe Honour and Glory was, about the ſame time, laid in the Duſt with the Ruines of that ſtately Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice. I ſay, I beheld the Author, much I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe after the ſame poſture <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Paulinus,</hi> Biſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> and <hi>Tyre,</hi> were in, when the violent perſecutions of the cruel Donatiſts ſo far prevailed, as to deſtroy thoſe ſumptuous Fabricks, ſet apart in thoſe Cities for God's true Worſhip and Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and which was doubtleſs, in effect, the ſame doleful condition which our pious Biſhops and Martyrs, the Famous <hi>Cranmer, Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, Ridley,</hi> &amp;c. were involved in, when the Flood-Gates of Romiſh Perſecution had overflowed the Land.</p>
            <p>I have obſerved, That Divines (the more to affect us with the greatneſs of God's Mercy, in continuing the purity of his Word and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments
<pb facs="tcp:47504:5"/>amongſt us) many times look back upon the ſometime flouriſhing eſtate of thoſe happy Souls, who lived under the conduct of their Godly Paſtors, in the famous Churches of <hi>Epheſus, Smyrna, Sardis,</hi> &amp;c. wherein, with pure and undaunted zeal, they ſang the Praiſes of their Glorified Saviour; until, by degrees, the rage of Heathen Enemies, either demoliſhed their Churches and Temples, or, which is worſe, introduced Idolatrous and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Worſhip into them. We need not now travel ſo far as <hi>Aſia</hi> nor <hi>Greece</hi> for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to inhaunſe our due reſentments of God's Benefits, on the one hand; nor to work in us a deteſtation of the Rage and Cruelty of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies of his Church and People, on the other: our neighbour Nation affords us too freſh and lively a Scene of the ſad Cataſtrophe which happened unto the Primitive Churches, that I had much rather cover with a Vail, than go about to expoſe unto publick view, did not the preſent occaſion invite me to ſay ſomething re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating thereunto.</p>
            <p>All the World knows with what great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Solemnity the Edict of <hi>Nantes</hi> was
<pb facs="tcp:47504:6"/>agreed upon and confirmed by the great King <hi>Henry</hi> the Fourth, for ſetling and aſſuring the Peace and Safety of the Proteſtant Churches and Subjects of <hi>France.</hi> The ſame Edict was renew'd and confirm'd by his Son <hi>Lewis</hi> the Thirteenth, and all the great Officers of his Kingdom, but how well kept, the forcing <hi>Rochel,</hi> &amp;c. may teſtifie.</p>
            <p>At the Coronation of the preſent King <hi>Lewis</hi> the Fourteenth, it was again amply confirm'd by him, as it had been before by his Father and Grandfather, and as ſolemnly ſworn unto as the Pyrenaean Treaty, ſo that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very body concluded the Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi> would not have been moleſted nor injur'd in his Reign; and yet it is in his time found by ſad experience, that they have been most of all oppreſſed and perſecuted, and that without a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pretence of taxing them of ingaging in the Projects of a Queen-mother, or Prince of <hi>Conde:</hi> but all Civil Diſſentions being past over and pacified, within the compaſs of theſe last twenty years, wherein they deſired only to live peaceably, under the protection of the Laws and publick Faith, contrary thereunto,
<pb facs="tcp:47504:6"/>the inſatiable rage of wicked Men hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived them of their Commands, Offices, and Employments, and the liberty of executing them, in Civil as well as Military Affairs; whereby many thouſands had ſtarved, had they not found ſupport and ſanctuary under the Wings of our great <hi>Defender</hi> of the true Faith. And whereas, by the Laws of the Land, there was no difference to be made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt Proteſtant and Popiſh Subjects, for en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying and executing all manner of Trades, and places of trust, the quite contrary hath been practis'd: the Courts of Judicature, wherein was an equal number of Counſellors and Judges of both Religions, for hearing and determining differences, have been ſuppreſs'd and quite alter'd; Attorneys, Apothecaries, Chirurgeons, and generally all other mecha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick and handycraft Trades, not permittedto gain or eat their bread in quiet. But which is most doleful of all to conſider, the Miniſters of the Goſpel are forbidden to preach the word of God, many of them ſlain, impriſoned, and baniſhed, their Churches pull'd down to the ground, and their flock diſpers'd over the face
<pb facs="tcp:47504:7"/>of the Earth, into <hi>England, Sweden, Italy, Denmark, Germany,</hi> &amp;c. as Sheep having no Shepherd, juſt as it happened unto their Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> for the ſame cauſe, above Five hundred Years ago; and the few that remain in the Land of their Nativity, waiting for the time that their King and Sovereign, like an other <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus,</hi> or <hi>Charlemain,</hi> his Royal and Religious Anceſtor, will give and proclaim deliverance unto the diſperſed Tribes, from their cruel Bondage, and from ſo great a Famine of the Word: for at preſent they many times ſee their young Infants yield up their innocent Souls, in carrying them unto places far diſtant, to receive the Seal of the Covenant of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm; others yielding up their Spirits with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Benefit or Help of their Spiritual Guide's conſolation at the hour of Death; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides many other great Miſeries which they daily ſuffer in Body, Soul, and Eſtate: So that the Pariſian Maacſſre was a kindneſs, being compared with the preſent uſage which the Proteſtants of <hi>France</hi> do receive by the dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of Romiſh Emiſſaries, and from their
<pb facs="tcp:47504:7"/>own unkind Countrymen; for that gave them a ſpeedy deliverance from all miſeries, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as they are now, as it were, held on the Rack, and made ſuffer a thouſand Deaths, before they are freed from the Burden of one miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Life.</p>
            <p>When our Neighbours and Brethrens Houſes are burning, and all in a Flame, for the ſame common Faith and Reformation, all Chriſtians that have any ſenſe of Religion and Piety, have great reaſon to unite their Prayers unto the God of Heaven, <hi>That he would be pleaſed to avert his juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from falling upon us for our great Impieties, and preſerve our Church and Nation from the ſad calamities which have ruined ſo many Chriſtian Families in</hi> France, &amp;c. <hi>and which threaten the like uſage unto the reſt of the Reformed World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I own, it is the ſingular Bleſſing of God, and by the Liberality of the great Encoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of Virtue and Learning, his Grace the Lord Primate and Chancellor of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that I am happy this day in addreſſing my
<pb facs="tcp:47504:8"/>ſelf unto you, almoſt in the Words of S. <hi>Paul</hi> unto <hi>Felix,</hi> the Roman Governour, in adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turing to ſpeak the more freely in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, becauſe you have been for many years a Righteous Judge unto this Nation, living ſo that Envy it ſelf dares not whiſper the leaſt Corruption or ſign of fear or favour to Friends or Enemies, and are perfectly ſenſible of the verity of theſe things, which I have only hint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at, to avoid Prolixity, leſt I may be thought to write a Book of Martyrs, rather than an Epiſtle Dedicatory.</p>
            <p>Our Gentry and Gallants formerly were wont, in great numbers, to flock and reſort un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Montpellier, Montauban, Bergerac,</hi> &amp;c. where they freely exchanged their Engliſh Gold for the Nouriſhment and Recreations they there found, both for Body and Soul. But now it may too truly be ſaid of thoſe places in particular, and of other whole Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces in general, <hi>That the Ark of God, their Glory, is departed from them:</hi> and they, as the Aſiatick Churches, are over-ſpread with thick and dark Clouds of Profaneneſs, Atheiſm, Ignorance, and Superſtition; ſo that
<pb facs="tcp:47504:8"/>thoſe who travel that way, may juſtly fear it will be to their damage both in Body and Soul. What was the pleaſant and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> when the Chriſtians were ſent out of it unto <hi>Pella,</hi> and other places? And what is <hi>France,</hi> but an <hi>Aceldama,</hi> now that the Proteſtants are expell'd, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the proceedings of the wiſe and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant Dealings of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth, who before he would ruine his Subjects for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, ſent Commiſſaries, and not Dragoons, into the ſeveral parts of his Dominions, to be juſtly informed of the truth of matters, who, upon the Report made unto him by his Commiſſaries, ſwore a great Oath in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Officers and Counſellors of State, That the Proteſtants were the beſt Subjects he had in his Kingdom, and thenceforward commanded that they ſhould not be moleſted in Body or Eſtate. And it is well known that the preſent King has much better know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and experience of his Proteſtant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Loyalty, than that great Prince had occaſion to know: ſo that it is hoped the ſiniſter Councils of a Plotting Jeſuitical Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb facs="tcp:47504:9"/>will not always prevail, to the Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine of ſo many faithful good Subjects, and of ſo flouriſhing a Kingdom.</p>
            <p>I have preſumed here to preſent unto you an Epitome of the chiefeſt revolutions which have occurred upon this tremendous Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of Chriſtian Religion, in the Eaſtern and Weſtern Churches, from the Apoſtles days unto the last Age, wherein the truth of the chiefeſt matters negotiated by Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors, Kings, Councils, Popes, Prelates, and the eminenteſt Doctors of the Church, in the ſeveral Centuries, are retrieved, and recited with as great integrity and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration aspoſſible can be.</p>
            <p>I have endeavoured to accommodate my ſelf unto the Author's ſenſe and terms, as near as I could; and if any paſſage ſeems to vary from the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> (which I do not obſerve through the whole Book) I hope to find a favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Cenſure, being only a Tranſlator and not the Author. If the Work be duely weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it will not ſtand in need of much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation for the buying and reading of it:
<pb facs="tcp:47504:9"/>ſuch generous WINE needs no Buſh; all is Loyal and Orthodox here; it recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends it ſelf unto all ſorts of Perſons that deſire to ſee the weightieſt matters of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion interwoven with the pleaſant light and truth of the purest Hiſtory of all Ages, whereby Faith, as well as Mens Reaſon, is improved and confirmed, to the eternal ſilencing of that common queſtion of the Gentlemen of the Roman Perſuaſion unto Proteſtants, in asking, <hi>Where their Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion was before</hi> Luther <hi>and</hi> Calvin? Here are Depths where Elephants may ſwim, the learned and curious may find ſweetneſs and ſatisfaction; alſo the weakest Lamb, the pious and devout Soul, may wade with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out fear, and go away plung'd and pleas'd in pleaſure and delight. And how could I better expoſe this Sacred Treaſure of Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Antiquity, unto publick view, than by recommending my weak endeavours herein unto your favourable acceptance and Patronage, having received the first deſign of coming to light near the famous Manſion of your worthy Progenitors, where for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral

            <head>THE Author's Preface Tranſlated from the FRENCH.</head>
            <p>THE Controverſies about Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a kind of War, or if you will a ſort of Law-Suit, wherein both Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties plead their Cauſe with ſome heat; it ſeems to me very difficult to write, and not let fall ſome words that may favour the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of that ſide for which we are concerned, becauſe the fleſh corrupts the acts of the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and the old Man never fails to viti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the purity of the thoughts of the new. I do not here ſpeak of thoſe angry Writers, who in all their Works, do ſhew an unlimited paſſion for the Cauſe which they defend, and meditate no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but diſparaging their Adverſaries, to make their own Party triumph by the Calumnies which they caſt upon the others. I ſpeak of mild and peaceable Spirits, who write with moderation;
<pb facs="tcp:47504:11"/>who, nevertheleſs, do it not alwaies ſo ſucceſsfully, but they let drop ſome things which all do not approve of, becauſe their ever remains frailty in man, and the innocency of the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> hath not a compleat victory over the firſt. What I ſay, is particularly verified in examining the Tradition of the Church, upon the Articles of our Faith; for both the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks and the Proteſtants, pretending that it is favourable to their Cauſe, each alledge out of the holy Fathers, to eſtabliſh their Belief and Religion. This conſideration makes me think that the ſureſt way, and moſt edifying means for Chriſtians, would be plainly to produce what hath been from time to time received and believed in the Church upon the points in Controverſie; and Hiſtorically without diſpute to repreſent the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents of our Anceſtors, upon all the Articles which are to be examined. This is what I have indeavoured to do upon the matter of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, which is, and will be alwaies (if God pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it not by his grace) a ſtone of ſtumbling, and a means which the Devil will never fail to uſe, to keep up amongſt Chriſtians that unhappy ſtrife wherewith they are ſo pleaſed, but which ought to draw tears of blood from thoſe good Souls that are ſenſibly touched for the glory of God, and that without ceaſing by their prayers deſire that he will give unto all, the grace to keep the unity of the ſpirit in the bond of peace. The better to ſucceed in my deſign, and to repreſent
<pb facs="tcp:47504:11"/>the Sacrament at large, I have divided my Work into three Parts: In the firſt, I examine the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Form of Celebration; I prove that Bread and Wine have alwaies been the matter of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament amongſt Chriſtians. I hint at the mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Water with the Wine in the holy Cup; and I endeavour to diſcover the Original, as well as the Myſterie which the ancient Doctors of the Church ſince S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> have ſought for in this mixture. I mention ſundry Sects of Hereticks, whereof ſome have changed the matter of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, others have corrupted the Celebration; and laſtly, others have quite rejected it, not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering that it ſhould be celebrated at all. I omit not what S. <hi>Ignatius</hi> ſaid of certain Hereticks who condemned the celebration, nor the Hereſie of one called <hi>Tanchelin,</hi> who alſo denied it, but through another Principle; I make ſome mention of the Slanders which the <hi>Jews</hi> and others, caſt upon Chriſtians by reaſon of the Sacrament; And I treat of the difference betwixt the <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Latin</hi> Churches, about the uſing of levened and unlevened Bread. Then I conſider whence the Bread and Wine of the Sacrament was taken, what was the faſhion of the Bread, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novations and changes which have thereupon hapned. From thence I proceed to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the place of Conſecration, of the matter of the Chalices and Patins, that is to ſay, the Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels which were uſed in this holy action; this conſideration is followed with an inquiry of the
<pb facs="tcp:47504:12"/>Language wherein Conſecration was made, and wherein all the Service was generally performed; and from this Inquiry, I proceed to the Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Ceremonies, and of the Form of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration; I mean, the words of Conſecration, to know whether the antient Church did conſecrate by Prayers, Bleſſings, and giving of Thanks, or by theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> as is now the practice of the Latin Church. Then I treat of the Oblation or the Form of the Sacrifice, and I ſhew the Reaſons and Motives which obliged the holy Fathers to give to the Euchariſt the name of Oblation and Sacrifice: I annex unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the Oblation, that of the Elevation, and of the Fraction; and I ſhew at what time the Latins began to lift up the Hoſt, to warn the people to adore it: moreover, I examine the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution and Communion, and in the firſt place, the Time, the Place, and the Poſture of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant, the Perſons who diſtributed, thoſe who communicated, with the words of the one and the other, and then of the Thing diſtributed, treating at large the Queſtion of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on under both kinds. I alſo ſhew, that for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Ages, Communicants received the Euchariſt with their hand; that they were permitted to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it unto their Houſes, and to carry it along with them in their Journeys and Travels; and that the ancient Chriſtians were ſo little ſcrupulous in this matter, that ſometimes they ſent the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto the Sick by Lay perſons, Men, Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,
<pb facs="tcp:47504:12"/>Acolytes, and young Boys; and not only ſo, but they made Plaiſters of it, they buried it with the Dead. In ſome Churches they burnt the remainder of the Sacrament, and in others, they cauſed it to be eaten by little Infants. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they took conſecrated Wine and mixed it with Ink, then they dipt their Pen in theſe mixt Liquors, the more to confirm the Acts they intended to ſign. In the Second Part, I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Hiſtory of the Doctrine of the Holy Fathers, upon this weighty Article, beginning with the reflections they have made upon the words of Inſtitution, and upon the interpretation they have given of theſe words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> and after theſe Reflections, I repreſent a great number of Teſtimonies, wherein they call the Euchariſt, <hi>Bread</hi> and <hi>Wine,</hi> in the very act of communicating; they affirm it is Bread which is broken, that it is Corn, Wheat, the fruit of the Vine, Fruits of the Earth, and like terms: They poſitively ſay, <hi>That it is Bread and Wine;</hi> Bread, wherewith our Bodies are nouriſhed, the matter whereof paſſeth through the natural accidents of our common Food, Bread which is conſumed in the celebration of the Sacrament. They affirm, that the Bread and the Cup, which we receive at the Lord's Table, are things inanimate; that the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine remain after Conſecration: and becauſe: one is found amongſt them that much varies from this language, I repreſent unto the Reader what ſome have ſaid to reconcile this Authour with
<pb facs="tcp:47504:13"/>others who have expreſſed themſelves otherwiſe than he hath done. Then re-aſſuming the thred of my Hiſtory, I make appear, that theſe ſame Doctors have believed, that participating of the Euchariſt, broke the faſt, and that they have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of what is received in the Communion, as of a thing whereof one received <hi>a little, a morſel, a piece, a ſmall portion.</hi> And having ſeen what they believed, and what they ſaid of the things which we receive in the Euchariſt, I inquire what they taught of the Uſe, the Office, and Imploy of the ſacred Symbols: And they tell us, that the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is the Sacrament, the Sign, the Figure, the Type, the Antitype, the Symbol, the Image, the Similitude, and the reſemblance of the Body and Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And the better to inſtruct us in the nature and force of theſe expreſſions, they will have us make theſe two obſervations, Firſt, that when they ſpeak of the Euchariſt as of a Sign, a Figure, an Image, it is in oppoſition to the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, which they conſider as abſent. The other is, that they conſtantly hold, that the Image and the Figure cannot be that whereof they are the Image and Figure. And indeed, not to leave their Doctrine expoſed unto the ſtroaks of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, they declare, that if the Euchariſt be a Figure, and an Image, it is not a bare Figure, nor an Image without operation; but a Figure, an Image, and a Sacrament repleniſhed with all the vertue and all the efficacy of the Body and Blood of our bleſſed Saviour, clothed, if it may be ſo
<pb facs="tcp:47504:13"/>ſaid, with the Majeſty of his perſon, and accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied in the lawful Celebration with all the fruits, and with all the benefits of his death and Sufferings. But becauſe the ſame Fathers who affirm that the Euchariſt is Bread and Wine, and who ſay, that it is the Sign, the Symbol, the Figure, and the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of our Saviour, do ſay alſo, That it is his Body and his Blood, that it paſſeth and is turned into his Body and Blood; I have not omitted to report the explications which they give us thereupon, and to ſhew which of thoſe ſorts of expreſſions they have limited; for by this means it is eaſie to comprehend their words, and intentions. Having ended the Examination of their Doctrine, I have applied my ſelf unto the ſearch and inquiry of its conſequence, to know if they believed the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Fleſh of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> with the mouth of the body, the eating of the ſame Fleſh by the wicked, as well as by the righteous, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord upon Earth, as to his Humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and how they underſtood the following Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims, whether a Body can be in ſeveral places at the ſame time; whether it can ſubſiſt inviſibly after the manner of a Spirit, without occupying any ſpace; whether what hath been done long ſince, can ſtill be done every day; whether the Cauſe can be later than the Effect; whether that which containeth, ought not to be greater than that which is contained; whether Accidents can exiſt without their Subject; whether the Senſes
<pb facs="tcp:47504:14"/>may be deceived in the report they make of ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Objects, when there is no defect in the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, or in the <hi>medium,</hi> or ſituation of the Object; whether a Body ought to be viſible, and palpable, and whether it ought to have its parts ſo diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed the one from the other, that each part ought to anſwer the reſpective part of place; whether there may be penetration of dimenſions; whether one may dwell in himſelf; whether a Body may be all intirely in one of its parts; and whether whatſoever is ſeen and touched, and falls under ſenſe, be a Body. And to the end nothing be wanting to eſtabliſh the Doctrine of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the point of the Euchariſt, I add unto direct proofs, a great many indirect proofs, taken from their words and actions, whence are drawn ſeveral inductions, which contribute very much to ſhew what were their ſentiments of this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of our Faith. Then I repreſent the Alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and changes happened in the ancient expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Doctrine, the conteſts of the Ninth Age, whereunto if I miſtake not, I have given much light by certain conſiderations, which ſhew as clear as the light, which of the two Opinions had the better, that of <hi>Paſchaſius,</hi> or that of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. The Hiſtory of the Tenth Age, ſhall be repreſented in ſuch a manner I hope, as will not be diſpleaſing unto the candid Reader, ſeeing it will inform him that in that Age, which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider neither as an Age of Darkneſs, nor of Light, but participating of both, wherein things paſſed
<pb facs="tcp:47504:14"/>otherwiſe than hath been hitherto believed. I treat exactly of what paſſed in the Eleventh Century, in regard of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> and his Followers; in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> in the Twelfth and Thirteenth Centuries; of <hi>Wicklif,</hi> and the <hi>Lollards</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> in the Fourteenth Age, of the <hi>Taborites</hi> in <hi>Bohemia;</hi> in the Fifteenth, and until the ſeparation of the Proteſtants, with ſome Obſervations which I make from Age to Age, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Greek</hi> Church. And in the laſt Part, wherein I treat of the Worſhip, I examine the preparations which precede the Celebration; I inquire the time wherein Chriſtians began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce in the exerciſe of their Religion, the uſe of Incenſe and Candles, eſpecially at the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Sacrament. Unto this practice, I add that of the ſign of the Croſs, and alſo of material Croſſes; the conſideration of holy Veſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and of thoſe particularly appointed for this holy Ceremony, not forgetting that of Flowers, which were uſed in form of Coronets, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, in honour of the Euchariſt. I make one Chapter of the diſpoſitions requiſite for a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant in reſpect of <hi>God,</hi> and of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and another, of thoſe which he ought to have in regard of the Sacrament; which ingageth me to ſpeak ſomething of Auricular Confeſſion, and to inquire whether the Holy Fathers have requir'd it as a diſpoſition abſolutely neceſſary unto a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Communion: And I conclude the whole Work with the queſtion of the Adoration of the
<pb facs="tcp:47504:15"/>Sacrament, which I treat of with ſome care and exactneſs, to the end, the Reader might ſee what hath been the Belief and practice of the ancient Church on ſo important a point as this is, and when the firſt Decrees were made for worſhipping the Hoſt.</p>
            <p>I know very well there can be nothing of te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony, be it never ſo clear; but the ſubtilty of men will find means to elude, and this is it which hath rendred, and will render the diſputes of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion immortal, many of thoſe who handle them, ſeeking more their own, than Gods glory, and examining the paſſages of the Ancients, with the prejudices they have been before prepoſſeſs'd with. Thence it is, that beholding them in a bad light, they can never rightly underſtand what was the true Belief of the Church upon the Controverſies wherewith it hath been agitated ſo many years. Nevertheleſs, there is nothing we ſhould more indeavour, than to repreſent, and diſcover the naked truth; not caring that men ſhould triumph over us, ſo that truth might tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over us all. It is with this deſign, that I have undertaken to diſcover ſincerely what Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians have believed in paſt Ages, and the Article of the Euchariſt, which ſeems to me, one of the moſt eſſential, and which cauſeth the greateſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion amongſt Chriſtians in the Weſt.</p>
            <p>But to the end that none may be miſtaken in the explication of the teſtimonies of the holy Fathers, and not ſwerve from their Intentions, I will propoſe
<pb facs="tcp:47504:15"/>ſome means, which ſeem not to me improper, and the practice whereof may be of great uſe unto all ſuch as deſire to be inſtructed in what they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. In the firſt place, their Works ought to be read without any prejudice, I ſpeak of their genuine, not forged, Works; for when one is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>occupy'd in favour of an Opinion, and ſets about reading them, one ſhall find, what is not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein, prejudice ſo darkning the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that many times the ſhadow is taken for the ſubſtance; and a fallacious appearance, for the truth, becauſe that prejudice predominates, and makes men incapable of rightly judging what they read; the Idea of the opinion which prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſeth us, ſo filling the faculty of the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it can receive no other impreſſion until we diſmiſs theſe prejudices. Wherefore the firſt thing to be done when we ſet about reading the Monuments, which we ſtill injoy, of Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, is well to examine our ſelves, to ſee if we be free from all ſorts of preoccupation. For, provided we bring unto this ſtudy nothing of our own, but attention, and a ſincere deſire of knowing the truth, we ſhall gather Fruits full of conſolation and joy, and we ſhall doubtleſs diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover, what hath been the belief of thoſe ancient Doctors upon the point which we examine. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, great heed muſt be taken not to ſeparate what God hath joined together, I mean, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the matter of the Symbols, from their efficacy, and from their vertue, in their lawful uſe:
<pb facs="tcp:47504:16"/>for then theſe things are inſeparable, although they be different one from another; for the nature of Bread and Wine is one thing, and the grace and vertue which the Conſecration addeth unto their nature, is another thing: and therefore it is, that the holy Fathers ſpake not ſo honourably of the Sacrament, when they conſider the ſubſtance of the Symbols, as when they regard their efficacy and vertue. And indeed, when they have a deſign to repreſent this efficacy, they make uſe of the loftieſt and moſt magnificent expreſſions, to raiſe the Dignity of this Myſterie, and to make us conceive a grand Idea of it; and certainly it is with great reaſon, becauſe 'tis a thing very worthy our admiration, and which I may ſay doth ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs our underſtanding, that <hi>Chriſt Jeſus</hi> ſhould accompany his Sacraments with ſo great a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, that he ſhould cleanſe our Souls with a few drops of Water, and that he ſhould nouriſh them with a few crumbs of Bread, and a few drops of Wine, but after a manner ſo Noble, ſo Heavenly, and ſo Divine, that all we can do is, to feel the fruits and advantages, without conceiving the manner, or how it is effected: And therein is ſeen <hi>that magnificence of the Works of God,
<note place="margin">Tertul. de Baptiſ. c. 2.</note> which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed in the effect;</hi> whereof <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſpeaks, and which he oppoſeth unto the <hi>ſimplicity of theſe ſame Works,</hi> which appears in <hi>the Action;</hi> and in reſpect of which Simplicity, the Fathers have expreſſed themſelves, in terms more humble, and not ſo lofty, agreeable unto the nature of Symbols. This
<pb facs="tcp:47504:16"/>ſecond means ſhall be follow'd by a third, which is not the leaſt conſiderable; and for the underſtanding whereof, it is neceſſary to obſerve, that the Holy Fathers have uſed two ſorts of expreſſions in ſpeaking of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt: by the one, they affirm, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is Bread and Wine; and by the other, they ſay, it is the Body and Blood of Chriſt: Theſe two ſorts of expreſſions taken literally, cannot agree together, nor be both true in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to one and the ſame Subject. For if the Euchariſt be properly the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it is not properly Bread; and if it be properly Bread, it cannot be underſtood to be properly the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the Fathers who have ſaid, that the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is Bread, have alſo ſaid that it is the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> how ſhall we then do, to give a right ſenſe unto expreſſions ſo different, and which in appearance are ſo inconſiſtent? That which we ſhould do, is maturely to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what theſe Holy Doctors have ſaid for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of their meaning; and that cannot better be done, than by diligently ſearching their Works; that of the two ſorts of expreſſions which they have uſed, they have reſtrained the one, without giving any limitation unto the other: for in equity it muſt be granted that thoſe which they have limited, ought not to be explained according to their intention, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the reſtrictions which they have uſed; and
<pb facs="tcp:47504:17"/>that on the contrary the others which have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived no limitation ſhould be underſtood ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply and abſolutely, and in the proper terms wherein they have expreſſed them; and to ſay the truth, had they intended that theſe two ſo different expreſſions ſhould have been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood in the ſame manner, wherefore ſhould they have taken ſo much care and pains to limit and reſtrain the one, and never heed to take the leaſt care in reſtraining or ſweetning the others? Such different proceedings in regard of theſe kinds of expreſſions, doth it not plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declare that they intended that they ſhould be differently underſtood, and that there ſhould be given unto thoſe which they have reſtrained, a Figurative and Metaphorical Senſe? and unto thoſe which were not reſtrained, a proper and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teral Senſe? that is to ſay, that the former ſhould be taken for Figurative Speeches, and the latter for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per expreſſions, and without any Figure. If then they have reſtrained and limited the expreſſions which do affirm that the Euchariſt is Bread and Wine, and if they have not limited thoſe which affirm that 'tis the Body and Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> it muſt be concluded, that thoſe which declare that the Sacrament is Bread and Wine, are improper and figurative Speeches; and that the others which ſay that it is the Body and Blood of our Lord, are proper and literal expreſſions. But if on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, they have taken exact care to reſtrain the propoſitions which ſay, That the Euchariſt is
<pb facs="tcp:47504:17"/>the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> without adding any limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the others which aſſerted that it is Bread, it muſt be neceſſarily infer'd, that when they ſaid that the Euchariſt is the Body of our Lord, they ſpake improperly and figuratively; and on the contrary, that they ſpake literally and properly, when they affirmed that it is Bread and Wine. Now the Reader will perceive in peruſing this Treatiſe, what manner of ſpeaking theſe Holy Doctors have uſed herein; for it is enough for me here to propoſe unto him the means of right underſtanding them.</p>
            <p>The fourth rule to be obſerved for the right underſtanding their teſtimonies, is not to make them claſh one againſt another, nor to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broil them in contradictions: for it muſt be ſuppoſed, that they were prudent and judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious enough not to contradict themſelves, and to keep themſelves from a reproach which would have been caſt on them, had that befaln them. There are two things in their works relating to the matter we treat of, which ſhould be carefully diſtinguiſhed, but in ſuch ſort as to take them always in good Senſe; I mean the ground of their Doctrine, and its conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And indeed the Doctrine of the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers having had its conſequences, as the greateſt number of Doctrines have had, it is evident that of two explications which may be given unto it, there is but one that is true; that which ſhall make a contradiction betwixt the Doctrine and its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences,
<pb facs="tcp:47504:18"/>and the conſequences and the Doctrine, is falſe, and contrary to their Intention; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as that, that reconciles both, is lawful and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine: for their Doctrine muſt be conſidered with its conſequences, as a Body, whereof all the parts ſhould have a dependance, the one to the other, and all tend to the ſame end, as ſo many lines to the center. I have examined a great many of theſe conſequences in this Hiſtory, to the end that thoſe who read it, may judge if they agree with the foundation of the Doctrine, and if the Doctrine and its conſequences; do favour the ſubſtantial change for if the conſequences favour this change, it will be a great preſumption that the Doctrine doth not disfavour it, although it ſhould not ſo po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively eſtabliſh it, as the Latins have done. But alſo if all theſe conſequences are directly oppoſite unto the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it will be a manifeſt proof, that the ground of the Doctrine is no leſs oppoſite unto it, and that the Antients have not received this Doctrine into the Object of their Faith, and that they made it not an Article of their Belief. This fourth rule ſhall be ſtrengthened with a fifth, which appears no leſs important unto me, and which only demands, that doubtful and uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain paſſages ought to be explained by certain paſſages, and the obſcure by the clear and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt ones. This is a Maxim of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s which I'll not alledge in this place, becauſe it is alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Body of the Work: but after all, there's
<pb facs="tcp:47504:18"/>nothing more juſt and reaſonable. It often befals moſt Authors to deliver themſelves more happily at one time than at another, though they treat of the ſame Subject; it happens un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome through neglect, or not having well di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted their thoughts, it being impoſſible to expreſs themſelves clearly on a Subject, if the mind have only confuſed notions of it; others do ſo for reaſon, which may here be ſaid particularly of the Fathers of the Church, when they treat of the Sacraments, principally of that of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; for there were certain Times and Places when they explained not themſelves ſo clearly as at other times, although they never ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing contrary to their Sentiments, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline of their times not ſuffering them to do otherwiſe. But however the matter hapned, it ſeems very juſt and equal when the mind of an Author would be known upon a matter which he hath treated in divers Places, in ſome places clearer than at others, to have recourſe unto thoſe Places wherein he hath moſt clearly explained himſelf, and by thoſe to interpret the others wherein he expreſſed himſelf more obſcurely, either through inadvertency, or for reaſon more darkly and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguouſly; this kind of proceeding is natural un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Mankind, and reaſon ſhews 'tis the ſafeſt way can be taken in theſe occaſions. I will not fear to ſay that 'tis the only means to termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate the Diſputes and Controverſies of Religion, becauſe, they all ariſing from the ſeveral interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb facs="tcp:47504:19"/>given unto paſſages of the Holy Scriptures, and of thoſe of the antient Doctors of the Church, they might be eaſily reconciled if Men would agree that the moſt clear and intelligible ſhould ſerve as a Commentary unto the more difficult and obſcure. Unto all theſe rules I will add a ſixth, which ſhall be the laſt. The Fathers being on this occaſion to be conſidered as witneſſes examin'd, to learn of them what was the belief of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Church touching the Sacrament, there's no queſtion to be made but that the greater number ought to be preferr'd before the leſs, and that the leſſer number ought to ſubmit unto the greater, things being otherwiſe alike; I mean both the one and the other being of equal Authority, and their Teſtimony alike worthy of belief: for inſtance, if eight or ten amongſt them ſhould unanimouſly depoſe, that the ſubſtance of the Bread and Wine of the Sacrament is aboliſhed by the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that there remain only the accidents and appearance, which ſubſiſt miraculouſly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Subject; and that there was but one, that ſaid to the contrary: It is not to be doubted but the teſtimony of the Ten, ought to be preferr'd before one ſingle Perſon; becauſe every one of the Ten is as credible in his particular, as he that is alone of his own Opinion, and that there is much more likelihood that one ſingle Perſon may be miſtaken in relating the belief of the Church, than ten Perſons that agree in their Teſtimonies. But by the ſame reaſon, if Ten be found that
<pb facs="tcp:47504:19"/>teſtifie that the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine remains after Conſecration; and that on the contrary, one ſingle Perſon ſhall ſay, it is changed into the ſubſtance of the Body and Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> we are obliged to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that the belief for the which the ten Perſons do declare, hath been the true Belief of the antient Church; and that the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this ſingle Perſon, is a particular O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion which ought to be rejected, or at the leaſt, if poſſible, endeavour to recover him unto the general Opinion believed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the Chriſtians of his time, by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving unto his words a more mild Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and the moſt favourable Conſtruction that may be. I think no Body can reaſonably condemn the Means which I have propoſed, the practice whereof may conduce very much to the right underſtanding of the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, provided we obſerve them ſincerely, and no other end be propoſed in explaining their Teſtimonies, but what I have had in reporting them in this Treatiſe, that is, a love of the Truth,

<pb facs="tcp:47504:24"/>contain the Doctrine of the holy Fathers, the true tradition of the Church, which derives its Original and Authority of what our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour ſaid unto his Diſciples, that the Bread which he gave them, was his Body broken, and the Cup his Blood ſhed, and in that he commanded them to celebrate this Sacrament in remembrance of him and of his death. And laſtly, the third ſhall examine the Worſhip, I mean the diſpoſitions which ought to precede the Communion, the motions of the Soul of the Communicant, whether it be in regard of God and of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or in regard of the Sacrament; in a word, all things which do relate unto it. And in each of theſe three Parts, we will obſerve, with the help of our bleſſed Saviour, all the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actneſs and ſincerity that can be, in ſhewing the Innovations and chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that have thereupon enſued.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is with very great diſpleaſure that I inſert in my firſt Eſſay of this nature, an Elogie, which never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs will render it very accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; I had much rather have wanted ſo good a Subject of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation to my firſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, than to have obtain'd it by ſuffering ſo great a loſs: But ſeeing Death will not be ſubject unto our deſires, let us acquit our ſelves ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the various conjunctures, whether they be pleaſing or not.</p>
            <p>Monſieur <hi>L'ARROQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E</hi> departed this Life at <hi>Roven,</hi> the 31 of <hi>January</hi> 1684, Aged 65 years, born at <hi>Lairac,</hi> a Town not far from <hi>Agen</hi> in <hi>Guien,</hi> his Father and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther dying almoſt at the ſame time, left him very young, under the Conduct of his Relations, and which is the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47504:26"/>common Fate of Scholars, without much Wealth; but his great love for Learning comforted him in the midſt of all his Troubles: Having made ſome progreſs therein under ſeveral Maſters, he advanced the ſame conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably in the Academy of <hi>Montauban,</hi> and having apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf unto the ſtudy of Divinity under Meſſieurs <hi>Charles,</hi> and <hi>Garriſoles,</hi> eminent Profeſſors, who alſo had at the ſame time the famous Monſieur <hi>Claud</hi> to be their Pupil, in a ſhort time he there made ſo great a progreſs in his ſtudies, that he was judged worthy of the Miniſtry: He was accordingly admitted betimes, and by the Synod of <hi>Guyen,</hi> ſent unto a little Church, called <hi>Poujols:</hi> He had ſcarce been there one year, but the Gentlemen of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> oppoſed his Miniſtry, which oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to make a Journey to <hi>Paris:</hi> He there became accquainted with Meſſieurs Le <hi>Faucheur,</hi> and <hi>Meſtrezat;</hi> who from that very time propheſi'd very advantagiouſly of him. He preached at <hi>Charanton</hi> with great Succeſs, and was ſo well approved by the late lady Dutcheſs of <hi>Tremouile,</hi> that ſhe deſired he might be ſetl'd at the Church of <hi>Vitry</hi> in <hi>Britany,</hi> where ſhe commonly made her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence. For ſeveral reaſons he conſented unto the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of this Princeſs, and went to <hi>Vitry,</hi> where he liv'd 26 years, ſo confin'd unto his Cloſet, that he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſpent 14 or 15 hours each day.</p>
            <p>The world ſoon became ſenſible of his great induſtry, by a Treatiſe which Monſieur <hi>L'ARROQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E</hi> publiſhed againſt a Miniſter, who having chang'd his Religion, cauſed to be Printed the motives which induced him thereunto. By this Anſwer it was ſeen the Author had already attained great knowledge in Antiquity, joyned with a very ſolid and clear way of reaſoning, which was ever the character of the late Monſieur <hi>L'AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ES</hi> Genius. Some years after, <hi>ſcil.</hi> in the year 1665, he made a very learned Anſwer unto the Book of the Office of the holy Sacrament, written by the Gentlmen
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47504:26"/>of <hi>Port Royal,</hi> wherein he ſhewed unto thoſe Illuſtrious Friars, that they had alledged and tranſlated the paſſages of Antient Fathers, either very negligently, or very falſly. His Hiſtory of the <hi>E<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>CHARIST</hi> (which may well be term'd his Maſter-piece) appeared four years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and did fully manifeſt the merits of this Excellent Perſon. Having compos'd ſo many Learn'd Volums, the Proteſtants of <hi>Paris,</hi> looked upon him as a Subject very worthy of their choice, and reſolved to eſtabliſh him in the midſt of them; this honeſt deſign had been accompliſh'd, had not his credit, and adhering unto the Intereſts of two Illuſtrious Perſons, whoſe names are ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently known, incited ſome envious
<note n="*" place="margin">Buſy Jeſuits.</note> Perſons to prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the King with prejudice againſt him. By this means they obtained an Injunction of not proceeding to this no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. The Marqueſs <hi>de Ruvigny</hi> appeared at Court in this affair, and ingag'd himſelf unto the King for Monſiuer <hi>L'ARROQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ES</hi> Zeal and Fidelity in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſties Service. The King (who is naturally inclin'd to goodneſs) thereupon anſwer'd the Marqueſs <hi>de Ruvigny</hi> the Deputy General, that ſome went about to give him other impreſſions of Monſieur <hi>L'ARROQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E,</hi> but ſeeing he would be Caution for the party accus'd, he would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this Miniſter to Exerciſe his profeſſion in any other place, excepting <hi>Paris.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A buſineſs of this moment made as great noiſe as could be imagin'd, but did not prejudice Monſieur <hi>L'ARROQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E,</hi> as much as his Enemies could have wiſhed; for ſoon after he was ſought unto by ſeveral conſiderable Churches, but he accepted of none, but the propoſal which was made unto him by that of <hi>Saumur.</hi> The Church and the Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demy were then vacant, both of a Miniſter and of a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor in Divinity; he was offer'd both, but whether it was through modeſty, or that he deſired not to vary from his former kind of Study, much different from that to be perform'd by a Profeſſor in Divinity, he only accepted the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47504:27"/>former. As he was preparing to enter upon it, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendant of the Province appear'd againſt it, for what rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is not known. The Conſiſtory of the Church of <hi>Sau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mur</hi> us'd ſuch Arguments to remove this Oppoſition, that in fine it was removed. Nevertheleſs Monſieur <hi>L'AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E</hi> thought it not convenient to accept the offer, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo advis'd by Monſieur <hi>Conrart,</hi> for whom he had a ſingular kindneſs, who repreſented unto him, that the Intendant would always bear him a grudge, and that therefore it would not be ſafe to be under his power.</p>
            <p>The Counſel of this incomparable Friend induced Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>L'ARROQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E</hi> to incline unto other offers, made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him at that time from divers places. The Church of <hi>Montauban,</hi> that of <hi>Bourdeaux,</hi> and that of <hi>Roven</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſir'd to have him for their Miniſter; he preferr'd the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before the two others, by the advice of Friends, he accordingly went to <hi>Roven,</hi> there to Exerciſe his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, and there 'twas that improving the rare Talents that God had endowed him with, he labour'd until his Death in the converſion of Souls, and in explaining the holy Scriptures with indefatigable diligence and Induſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Roven</hi> was a place very convenient for ſuch a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, for 'tis a City abounding with great wits, and well furniſh'd with good Libraries: He there acquired a great reputation amongſt the learned Men, even of the Contrary party; And the Illuſtrious Monſieur <hi>Bigot,</hi> at whoſe Houſe they Aſſemble once a week, and entertain curious and learned diſcourſe, was very well pleas'd to have Monſieur <hi>L'ARROQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E</hi> of the number, who alſo went unto their Aſſembly, where his profound Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg in Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, was much admired and eſteem'd by them all.</p>
            <p>A little after his coming to <hi>Roven,</hi> Monſieur <hi>David,</hi> ſo well known amongſt the learned for his great Literature, and by his conteſts with Meſſieurs <hi>de Marca, Juſtel,</hi> and <hi>de Launay,</hi> carped at him about one of the two Latin
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:47504:27"/>Diſſertations which he publiſh'd in the year 1670. and dedicated unto Monſieur <hi>d'Amproux,</hi> Councellor in the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> whoſe Wit, Probity and Learning are eſteem'd by all who know him. Monſieur <hi>L'AR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ROQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E</hi> had refuted the Opinion of Father <hi>Petau,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time of the Birth and Condemnation of the Hiſtory of <hi>Photin.</hi> His Reaſons appeared very ſolid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a great many, but Monſieur <hi>David,</hi> who otherways was well ſatisfi'd Father <hi>Petau</hi>'s <hi>Epoch</hi> was wrong, fanci'd that Monſieur <hi>L'ARROQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E</hi> had not ſufficiently refuted it, therefore took occaſion to write againſt him, which was the cauſe of Monſieur <hi>L'ARROQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ES</hi> reply, which he dedicated unto Monſieur <hi>Conrart,</hi> an intimate Friend to them both.</p>
            <p>Since which time this learned Miniſter hath publiſh'd divers excellent Treatiſes on ſeveral Subjects. He wrote one, intituled, <hi>Conſiderations upon the Nature of the Church;</hi> Another much larger, wherein he ſhews the conformity of the Diſcipline of the Proteſtants of <hi>France,</hi> with that of the Primitive Church. Another in Latin, in defence of the Sentiments of Monſieur <hi>Daille</hi> touching St <hi>Ignatius</hi> his Letters, and the Apoſtolical Conſtitutions, againſt Meſſieurs <hi>Pearſon,</hi> and <hi>Beverige,</hi> two famous Engliſh Doctors. They have writ a ſecond time in defence of their Opinion, and he had deſigned a Reply, as hath been ſeen by a Manuſcript Copy found near finiſh'd amongſt his Papers, but at the requeſt of ſome perſons favouring Epiſcopacy, he did not finiſh his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. The laſt work he publiſh'd is an Anſwer unto a Treatiſe of the Biſhop of <hi>Meaux,</hi> of the Communion under both kinds; although his name was not to it, yet it was judged to be his; it was known by the manner in which it was written, clear, free from digreſſions and ſuperfluous Ornaments, and full of ſolid remarks drawn from the profoundeſt Antiquity.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:47504:28"/>
            <p>But how great an Idea ſoever the printed Works of the late Monſieur <hi>L'ARROQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E</hi> gives us of the greatneſs and Exactneſs of his Wiſdom, it may be termed but ſmall, in compariſon of what would have been ſeen if God had been pleas'd to have ſpared him to finiſh what he had begun; he being eſteemed one of the fitteſt men of <hi>France</hi> to compoſe an Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, all his Friends in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated him to ſet about it, and accordingly he labour'd effectually therein with all diligence; He intended to have publiſhed one Volume every year, and to have joyned thereunto ſundry diſſertations, which would e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually have demonſtrated his ſincerity and his learning; He had carry'd on his work but unto the middle of the fourth Century, which is the only thing the publick will not loſe of ſo vaſt and rich a Structure. There was alſo found amongſt his Papers a very exact Treatiſe of the <hi>Regale,</hi> wherein he proves, that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> ſince <hi>Clovis,</hi> had this Right over all the Cathedral Churches in their Kingdom. This with ſome other ſmall Tracts, which this Illuſtrious perſon had finiſh'd before his Death, may make a compleat Volume; Monſieur <hi>L'ARROQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E</hi> the worthy Son of ſuch a Father, will be careful of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating them unto the World.</p>
            <p>But he confines not himſelf only thereunto, he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeth alſo an Exact Collection of all the Diſſertations which he hath found in the Hiſtory of the firſt 350 years of the Church, and he intends to publiſh them in Latin, for the benefit of Strangers. Every body will be glad to hear this News, eſpecially if we add ſomwhat touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the particulars of this Collection. Therefore I now give notice that therein will be ſeen, Diſſertations 1. Upon the thundering Legion, where ſhall be ſhewn, that what hath been ſaid of it, is very uncertain. 2.

            <p>All we have hitherto ſaid, refers unto the Wiſdom of Monſieur <hi>L'ARROQ<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>E,</hi> which indeed is a very vaſt and ſpacious Field; but ſhould we ſpeak of the qualities of his Soul, we ſhould have much more matter to inſiſt on. He had a Soul ſo ſincere as is ſcarcely to be found in this Age; he without envy beheld the merits of other learned perſons, and eſteemed their good qualities; he was a great and ſtrict obſerver of Diſcipline, and contented not himſelf to declaim in the Pulpit againſt Vice in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, but perſecuted it in all places, running the hazard of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47504:29"/>creating himſelf Enemies, by the ſecurity of his life; he preached by example and diſcover'd a true Chriſtian Conſtancy in all the troubles of his life; he diſcharged his Duty with ſo much exactneſs, that he would never diſcontinue performing his Function during an Ague which held him ten Months, after his being call'd to <hi>Saumur;</hi> I ſay he would neither diſcontinue the Duties of his Miniſtry, nor thoſe of his ſtudies, although the Phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians told him, that a diſtemper which often had fits of 36 hours would not be removed, if he did not give himſelf ſome repoſe. The Troubles of the Churches of <hi>France</hi> theſe laſt years, were incomparably more grievous unto him, than any particular Afflictions unto his own Family could have been, and ſhould theſe Misfortunes continue, what <hi>Cicero</hi> ſaid of another, may be ſaid of him; <hi>Ii rempublicam caſus ſequuti ſunt, ut mihi non erepta L.

                     <p>Wherein is treated of the Matter of the Sacrament.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE firſt thing that preſents it ſelf in the Celebration of the Euchariſt, is the matter of the Sacrament, that is to ſay, the Bread and Wine; for three of the Evangeliſts and St. <hi>Paul</hi> teſtifie that Jeſus Chriſt took Bread, and a Cup wherein there was Wine, and that he called the Wine, <hi>the fruit of the Vine:</hi> All the Holy Fathers unanimouſly avouch the ſame, all the Liturgies which are come to our hands depoſe the ſame, ſeeing we find theſe two Elements imployed in this myſtery; and the form of Celebration propoſed unto us by St. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> the Author of the <hi>Apoſtolical Conſtitutions,</hi> St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in his <hi>Myſtagogicks,</hi> the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:47504:30"/>pretended <hi>Denis</hi> the <hi>Arcopagite</hi> in his Hierarchy, and generally all thoſe which have writ on this ſubject, ſuffer us not to doubt of it, as neither doth the defence, which the Fathers and Councils have made, of offering any thing elſe but Bread and Wine in celebrating the Sacrament. Alſo all Chriſtians generally agree herein; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would be ſuperfluous to ſtand to prove it, ſeeing the thing is clear, and it is granted by all the World, and all Chriſtian Societies are agreed on this Subject. It will only be neceſſary to conſider that Jeſus Chriſt, which is the Wiſdom of the Eternal Father, and who never did any thing but with a Wiſdom and Conduct worthy of himſelf, did not chuſe Bread and Wine to make them Symbols of his body and blood, but that he was thereunto induced for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Reaſons.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs I will not now ſtand to examine the Reaſons which obliged him to make this choice, I refer that unto Divines, whoſe drift it is to inquire into this matter; it will ſerve our turn to ſay, that our Saviour having a deſign by means of his Sacraments, to raiſe up the minds of Chriſtians unto the conſideration of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts they find in his bleſſed Communion; he made choice of Elements which had ſome likeneſs and relation unto thoſe things which they were to ſignifie and repreſent: as for Inſtance, When he inſtituted the Sacrament of Baptiſm, which is the Sacrament whereby we are born into his Church, he made choice of water to be the ſign and ſymbol of it; becauſe it is proper to repreſent the vertue of his Blood and of his Spirit for the purifying of our ſouls: for as water hath the quality of cleanſing our bodies from all uncleanneſs; ſo alſo the Blood and Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, have the vertue, the force, and efficacy of waſhing and purifying our ſouls from all fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs and impurities; therefore it is, that the Apoſtle calls Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm <hi>the waſhing of Regeneration,</hi>

<note place="margin">Eph. 5.</note> that Chriſt hath <hi>cleanſed the Church by the waſhing of water by the Word;</hi> in like manner when he inſtituted the Euchariſt, which is another Sacrament of his Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant whereby he gives unto us life, after having given us our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he choſe Bread and Wine to repreſent unto us the vertue of his Sacrifice and of his Death, and which is the food of our ſouls: For as Bread &amp; Wine are food very proper for nouriſhing the body, and for preſerving this mortal and periſhing life; even ſo his Body broken, and his Blood poured out, do divinely feed and nouriſh our ſouls, and do admirably preſerve this heavenly and Spiritual life, whereof we enjoy even here below, ſome fore-taſtes and firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits, the accompliſhment whereof we ſhall one day receive to our comfort in Heaven. And it is in regard of this wonderful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect,
<note place="margin">John 6.</note> 
                     <hi>that his Fleſh is meat indeed, and his Blood is drink indeed;</hi> and
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:47504:30"/>that thoſe <hi>who eat this Fleſh, and drink this Blood, have life everlaſting;</hi> and that they ſhall be raiſed unto glory and immortality in the laſt day. Nevertheleſs, it muſt be granted, that the relation and reſemblance which the Bread and Wine may naturally have with the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, is a general, uncertain, and undetermin'd reſemblance, and which of it ſelf is not ſufficient to make them Sacraments of this Divine Body, and of this precious Blood. It is neceſſary that the Benediction and Conſecration con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer upon them this quality, and inveſt them with this dignity, which they cannot have by Nature; and that ſetting them apart from the prophane and common uſes, which they have in Nature, it ſhould apply them unto a Religious and Divine uſe in Grace. Nevertheleſs it may be affirm'd, that this likeneſs and relation which they have by Nature with the Body and Blood of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Saviour, were, as it may be ſaid, the firſt ground and the firſt motive of the choice which our Saviour was pleas'd to make of them; for what St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid in one of his Letters, may well be apply'd unto this matter:

<pb n="4" facs="tcp:47504:31"/>impoſſible, conſidering the ſilence of the Evangeliſts and of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to determine whether the Wine imploy'd in the celebrating of his Sacrament, was mixed with water or not: Nevertheleſs it is moſt certain that the Ancients believed there was water mingled with the Wine, and that it was upon this perſwaſion that they eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed the cuſtom of ſo doing; a very ancient practice, ſeeing that St. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> who wrote about fifty two years after the death of St. <hi>John,</hi> doth expreſly mention it: for in ſhewing the manner of celebrating the Sacrament in his time,

Indeed as the firſt Chriſtians ſought not ſo many myſteries as thoſe which came after, I mean that they troubled not themſelves in ſeeking out of Myſteries in moſt things relating to Religion, ſo they ſatisfy'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the innocent practice of this cuſtom, and religiouſly to obſerve this uſe, with much ſimplicity; but about one hundred years after St. <hi>Juſtin</hi> had writ what is above expreſs'd, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thought themſelves of ſeeking a myſtery in this mingling of water with the Wine: The firſt, if I miſtake not, that pleaſed himſelf to diſcover a Myſtical ſignification in the Wine and Water in the holy Cup, and of the mingling the one with the other was the glorious Martyr S. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who would that the Wine ſhould repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the Water ſhould ſhew the believing people, and that the mingling the one with the other, ſhould ſhew the indiſſoluble union which there is betwixt Chriſt and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;

Therefore it is not permitted in conſecrating the Cup of Our Lord, to offer Wine alone, or Water alone; for if only Wine were offered, it might be ſaid that the Blood was ſeparate from the people; and if only Water were offered, it might be ſaid the people were abſent from Chriſt; but when they are mingled and inſeparably joyn'd together, then is effected the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and Heavenly Sacrament.</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> was followed by the

                  <p>THE firſt Hereticks which the Devil ſtirred up to trouble the Church upon the matter of the Sacraments, were the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> that is, ſuch as aſſumed to themſelves that proud and inſolent Title, to perſwade the ignorant People that they were poſſeſt with great Wiſdom, and that they were able to dive into the knowledge of the moſt obſcure and difficult Myſteries: ſome derive their Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from the <hi>Nicolaïtans;</hi> others ſay they had for their Leader an eminent Heretick called <hi>Carpocrates:</hi> but from what Original ſoever they came, it cannot be doubted, but it was very pernicious, ſeeing it produced ſo curſed an off-ſpring; certainly this fountain was very corrupt, ſeeing the ſtreams were ſo infectious; and the Root of this curſed Tree was very venemous, ſeeing the Branches produced no leſs than the bitter Fruit of mortal Poiſon; an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous brood as ever was, whoſe Myſteries abounded with Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination and Horrour; therefore were they alſo called <hi>Borborites</hi> or <hi>Borborians,</hi> to denote their filthineſs and vileneſs: theſe miſerable wretches ſuffered themſelves to be ſwayed by their own corrupt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, and being Slaves unto their paſſions and diſordered Luſts, they polluted themſelves frequently with Women, which were in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon amongſt them; and coveting nothing more than this filthy pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, they were blindly led on by their wicked concupiſcence, and without any reſtraint wallowed in the moſt brutiſh Actions, the very thoughts whereof fills me with amazement and horror: But what is moſt dreadful and ſtrange in the conduct of theſe Organs of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Spirit, is, that they acted their greateſt abominations in their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies, and in the Places where they were accuſtomed to meet to exerciſe their Diabolical Religion. S. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> who more exactly than any other of the Antients relates unto us all that paſſed in the abominable myſteries of theſe Wretches, is aſhamed to write, and were it not in ſome ſort neceſſary to be publiſhed to render them o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious unto all the World, he would have forborn to have related the Brutalities and Filthineſſes which they were not aſhamed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit.

<pb n="8" facs="tcp:47504:33"/>reciting all the Impurities which were acted in the Aſſemblies of theſe milerable Creatures, which cannot be read without horrour; and on this occaſion I had rather imitate the modeſty of S. <hi>Cyrill</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> than the liberty of S. <hi>Epiphanius;</hi> that is, be as wary in writing theſe abominable Myſteries, as S. <hi>Cyrill</hi> was in Preaching, when he was abſolutely neceſſitated to ſay ſomething of them. Nevertheleſs thoſe who deſire to ſee the particularities of what paſſed in the Celebration,
<note place="margin">Epiphan. hareſ. 26.</note> which theſe miſerable Wretches pretended to make in the Euchariſt, need only read what S. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius</hi> hath writ in the Hereſie of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> whilſt I ſhall only mark, that when any of the Women, which they had debaucht, were with Child, they uſed means to make her miſcarry, and diſcharge her burthen when they liſted: then would they take the Infant and pound it in a Mortar with Honey, Pepper, and other Aromatick drugs; after which, this Fraternity of Swine and Doggs being aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled, each of them would take of this Infant ſo pounded, and would eat of it; which done, they would make their Prayers unto God, and eſteemed this Ceremony for a perfect and compleat Sacrament: And becauſe theſe abominable Hereticks aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the name of Chriſtians, they were the cauſe that Pagans and Infidels imputed unto the whole Chriſtian Church theſe hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible impieties, and it was the end which Satan propoſed in raiſing up theſe execrable Wretches.

But becauſe ſome of the Fathers have ſaid that the <hi>Montaniſts</hi> and <hi>Pepuſians</hi> practiſed ſomething very like the abominations of the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> it will be neceſſary, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving treated of the Myſteries of the one, to examine and treat of the Myſteries and Euchariſt of the others. <hi>Montanus</hi> was an Arch-Heretick, born in a Village called <hi>Ardaba</hi> in a part of <hi>Myſſia</hi> bordering upon <hi>Phrygia,</hi> and not being able to ſatisfie his Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which made him aſpire unto the chiefeſt power in the place of his Birth, he ſuffered himſelf to be corrupted with the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of the Devil, and as if he had been poſſeſt with a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Spirit; he undertook to reveal things to come, and choſe for his Companions <hi>Priſcilla</hi> and <hi>Maximilla,</hi> which he made paſs for Propheteſſes: Some ſay, that he called himſelf the <hi>Paraclete;</hi> others ſay, that he taught that it was in him the promiſe was to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, which <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt made of ſending his Spirit after his Aſcenſion into Heaven, and not upon the Apoſtles, as the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel doth teſtifie: S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> and others ſay that he differed nothing from the Catholicks and the Orthodox as to matter of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, but only as to Diſcipline, which he eſtabliſhed more ſtrict and auſtere than other Chriſtians. This ſeverity was ſo taking with <hi>Tertullian,</hi> that he ſuffered himſelf to be ſurprized, and was ſo obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, that although he was one of the greateſt Wits and learnedſt Men of his time, yet he called the Catholicks mere Libertines, Senſual and Carnal; but in fine, he left great Numbers of Sectaries and Followers, which, from him, were called <hi>Montaniſts; Cataphrygians,</hi> from <hi>Phrygia,</hi> where they made their chiefeſt reſidence; and <hi>Pepuſians,</hi>

From hence it was they were called by the name of <hi>Ophites,</hi> as who ſhould ſay, the Diſciples or worſhippers of the Serpent, which by the report of <hi>Tertullian</hi> they preferred before <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Tertul. de praeſcript. Cap. 47.</note> as having given unto mankind the Knowledge of good and Evil. They taught that <hi>Moſes</hi> having underſtood the power and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of them, made one of braſs, and that all thoſe that beheld it, were made whole; that <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt himſelf in the Goſpel imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the power of the holy Serpent, in ſaying, as <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the Serpent in the Wilderneſs, ſo alſo ſhall the Son of Man be lifted up; and ſeveral other things which are to be found in the Works of thoſe which have written of Hereſies, eſpecially in S. <hi>Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phanius, Theodoret,</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> this laſt ſaying, they affirmed that the Serpent which deceived <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> was <hi>Jeſus</hi> Chriſt: but what makes properly for the Subject we treat of, and whereto all the Antients agree, is, that they bred up a <hi>Serpent</hi> or <hi>Snake,</hi> which they tam'd, and made to come out of the hollow place where he lay, at the time that they intended to celebrate their ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and wicked Euchariſt; and that by Sorcery they made it come upon the Table where they celebrated, to the end it ſhould lick their Oblations, and that it ſhould roll and twiſt it ſelf round about them; after which they broke them, and it became their Euchariſt, ſanctified by the Serpent Chriſt. Thus it is related by S. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> but becauſe S. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> ſpeaks yet more diſtinctly,

<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 38.</note> in this part of the Goſpel whereof we now diſpute, we are not permitted to underſtand any thing elſe but what we are taught by our Saviours own words, who ſaith,</hi> This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood; <hi>and according to this rule, whereby the Cup is termed the New Teſtament, is very juſtly to be underſtood the Old Teſtament in the Cup which he gave firſt: The ſame Lord then which gave unto his Diſciples both Teſtaments, gave alſo both Cups; therefore at the ſame Supper he eat of the Jewiſh Paſſover, which was to be offer'd, and diſtributed the Sacrament of his Body and Blood, which was to be inſtituted for the Salvation of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers; he eat the Paſſover of the</hi> Jews, <hi>whereby</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to come unto our Paſſover, which he became, when ſacrificed himſelf. In fine, conſider what the Evangeliſt St.</hi> Luke <hi>relates that he ſaid unto his Diſciples; for he ſaith thus,</hi> When the hour was come, he ſate down at the Table, and the twelve Apoſtles with him, and he ſaid unto
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:47504:37"/>them, With deſire have I deſired to eat this Paſſover with you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſuffer: <hi>he eat therefore the Paſſover, by which he was repreſented to ſuffer, before he ſuffered voluntarily for us; there is alſo in the words of our Saviour ſomething which ought diligently to be conſidered by Believers, and wherein may be perceived a difference betwixt both Teſtaments; for St.</hi> Luke <hi>thus ſpeaketh of the Cup which he firſt mentioned,</hi> And having taken the Cup, he gave Thanks, and ſaid, Take ye it, and divide it amongſt you; <hi>but ſpeaking afterwards of the Bread and the Cup, he ſaith,</hi> And having taken the Bread, he gave Thanks, and broke it, and gave it unto them, ſaying, This is my Body which is given for you, do this in remembrance of me. Alſo he gave them the Cup after Supper, ſaying, This Cup is the New Teſtament in my Blood which is ſhed for you Of all the opinions or divers Interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons cited by St. <hi>Fulgentius,</hi> I find his own the moſt reaſonable, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in effect St. <hi>Luke</hi> hath mentioned two ſeveral Cups, the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal Cup, and the Euchariſtical Cup; the former being a Sign and Seal of the firſt Covenant, and the latter the Sign and Seal of the new Covenant. If this Evangeliſt hath not taken notice of our Saviours ſaying of the Euchariſtical Cup, <hi>I will drink no more of the Fruit of the Vine,</hi> but only in ſpeaking of the Paſchal Cup, it is in the firſt place becauſe he conſidered our Saviours whole action to be but one Supper, at the end whereof he inſtituted the Sacrament of the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> ſo that 'tis as if he ſhould have made our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ſay, After this Supper, and my now ſitting at Table with you, <hi>I will drink no more of the Fruit of the Vine.</hi> Secondly, That although <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> might have ſaid ſo of the two Cups, the Paſchal and Euchariſtical; yet nevertheleſs <hi>S.

I farther confeſs that if thoſe Hereticks which I ſuppoſe to be the <hi>Docetes</hi> and <hi>Putatives,</hi> that is, thoſe which denyed the Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt, and which only allow'd him an imaginary Body, a fantome and ſhadow of a Body: I ſay, I grant, that had they acted according to their Hypotheſis, they would not have allowed of the Euchariſt, ſeeing they could not allow it without ruining their abominable Doctrine, by an infallible conſequence. But this is not the place to conſider what they ought to have done, but what they did: now it is moſt certain that in the time of the true S. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> none of theſe Hereticks denyed the Euchariſt, for none of the Antients have obſerved it; which they would not have omitted to do, as well thoſe which have treated of Hereſies, as thoſe which have written parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly againſt the Hereticks whereof we now treat, The

                  <p>But becauſe a Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand, as our Saviour ſaith in the Goſpel, and that nothing is more pernicious unto a State than civil and inteſtine Wars, there's no queſtion to be made but the Devil thought conſiderably to advance his deſign, when he, as it were, armed and ſtirred up the Greek Church againſt the Latin Church, touching the nature and quality of the Bread of the <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> the Greeks affirming, That it was Leavened, and the Latins on the contrary contending for the uſe of Unleavened Bread. It muſt be granted the Greeks were miſtaken in affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> celebrated the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> with Leavened Bread; for it is certain that when he did celebrate it, there was no Leaven at all ſuffered to be kept amongſt the people of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> Thence it is that the holy Scripture calls thoſe days <hi>The days of unleavened Bread:</hi> What likelihood was there then that our Saviour ſhould uſe Leavened Bread in his Sacrament, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there was none in all <hi>Judea,</hi> and that the Jews were not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to have any? But it alſo muſt be confeſſed that the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins were not wholly without Blame, to be ſo ſelf-will'd or obſtinate in employing unleavened Bread in their <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a pretence that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> uſed it in his, making a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rule of a particular Occaſion, which ought not in reaſon to be inſiſted upon: For inaſmuch as our Saviour uſed unleavened Bread, it was through the cuſtom of the time, which ſuffered him not to have any other, ſeeing there was no other in the whole Country: But in the main, the deſign of the Son of God being to give us, in the <hi>Symboles</hi> of his Sacrament, a Figure of the vertue and efficacy of his Body broken, and of his Blood ſhed for the nouriſhment of our Souls, by the relation they have unto the vertue of theſe two Elements for the nouriſhing our Bodies; it is very evident that he would have the ſame Bread uſed to make his <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> and the ſame Wine, which were commonly uſed for the preſerving of life; ſo that if there were any Chriſtian Nation found, which uſed Bread without Leven for their ordinary Food, there is no queſtion to be made, but they may be permitted to uſe it for the celebration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that they ought to make uſe of it: But in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treys where Leavened Bread is uſed for the feeding of Men, no other ſhould be ſought after for the Sacrament. If the Bread be the Sacrament of the Body of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> it is not ſo as lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened or unleavened, but only as it is Bread, fit to nouriſh us, and as broken to repreſent unto us the painful Death of our Saviour upon the Croſs; therefore it is that it ought to be uſed according to the diverſity of the places where one reſides. I ſay
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:47504:42"/>that no other Bread ſhould be uſed in the Celebration of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> but the ſame Bread which is eaten for our common Food; and when I ſay that the Latins are not wholly without blame, in ſo ſcrupuloully obſerving the uſe of unleavened Bread, I do not regard it ſimply, but in reſpect of what hath been practiſed ſome Ages paſt: for they uſed leavened Bread in their Sacrament a great while, as other Chriſtian Communions did; the Bread and Wine of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> being taken from the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings which Chriſtians offered upon the Table in the Church at the uſual times that they aſſembled unto the Communion, as we ſhall make appear in the Fourth Chapter, which will plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly evidence, That theſe Offerings were of the very ſame kind of Bread, as that which was uſed in the ordinary actions of Life; and if in proceſs of time, there enſued any alteration, it was not in reſpect of the nature or quality of Bread: as if that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon uſe was leavened, and that of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> unleavened, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it was but one and the ſame ſort of Bread; all the difference conſiſted, firſt, in that the Bread of the <hi>Euchariſt</hi> was to be of a round form; ſecondly, about the ſeventh Century they began to prepare it expreſly and on purpoſe for the celebrating of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as appears by the ſixth Canon of the ſixteenth Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> aſſembled <hi>Anno</hi> 693. which we will cite at large in the following Chapter, by ſome words of Cardinal <hi>Humbert,</hi>

                     <p>Wherein is ſhewed from whence were taken the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt, and what was the form of the Bread, with the innovations and changes which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued thereupon.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT is not ſufficient to ſhew that Bread and Wine have always been the matter of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt amongſt Chriſtians, excepting ſome few Hereticks which had changed it, others that had miſerably altered and corrupted the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration; and in fine, others which had wholly rejected it, though upon ſeveral motives and different Principles: Neither is it ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to have hinted at the reproaches which were made againſt Chriſtians upon account of the Bread and Wine in this Divine Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and to have examined the great controverſy which armed (if it may be ſo ſaid) the <hi>Greek</hi> Church againſt the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, in the XI. Century, touching the Nature and quality of the Bread of the Sacrament, to know whether it ſhould be Leavened or Unleavened. To the end nothing ſhould be wanting unto this conſideration, we muſt endeavour to find out from whence was taken the Bread and Wine, imployed by Chriſtians in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Sacrament. I make no queſtion but they proceeded from the liberality of Believers, who being inflamed in thoſe hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py times, with the divine fire of Charity, which the Antients term, <hi>The mother and root of all Riches, the death of Sin, the life of Virtue, and the way which leads unto Paradiſe;</hi> they chearfully with their Goods relieved the neceſſities of the Church, whereof they were Members, and in the Communion of which the Lord was pleaſed by his grace to ſettle them, to make them partakers of his great Salvation. S. <hi>Luke</hi> gives us ſo clear and full a repreſentation in the ſecond Chapter of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles, that it cannot be thought of without admiration, and at the ſame time, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lamenting and deploring the dulneſs and coldneſs of theſe laſt times, wherein is too plainly ſeen the accompliſhment of the words of our Saviour who foretold, <hi>That iniquity ſhould abound, and the love of many ſhould wax cold.</hi> But at the beginning of Chriſtian Religion, as this charity was in its greateſt beauty, the whole Church offered unto God upon the Table every Lords day, or
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:47504:44"/>on the days when they Aſſembled to participate of this Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of their Salvation, and of there Union, their Oblations for the ſupport of their Spiritual Guides or Miniſters, for the relief of their Poor, and for the other Neceſſities of the whole Church; and out of theſe Offerings there was taken as much Bread and Wine as was needful for the holy Communion; a cuſtom which if I miſtake not, began to be practiſed in the days of the Apoſtles: for S. <hi>Clement</hi> one of their Diſciples,
<note place="margin">Clement. Epiſt ad Cor. p. 53.</note> ſpeaks of it as of a matter already eſtabliſhed, in that excellent Letter which he wrote unto the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> in the name of that of <hi>Rome,</hi> whereof he was one of the Paſtours. <hi>Thoſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>which make their oblations at the time appointed, are agreeable and bleſſed; for obeying the command of God, they do not ſin.</hi>

                  <p>Nevertheleſs, this is not all that we intend to obſerve: every one may eaſily judge by what hath been hitherto ſaid, that what was offered for the celebration of the Sacrament, was Bread and Wine; but it may be all the world do not know, that they were not the only things which were offered at firſt: for the charitable Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations

Apoſt. &amp; can. 4.</note> Milk, Birds, Beaſts or Roots upon the Altar; and in the fourth it allows of offering Oyl for the lights, and incenſe for the times of Oblation. But to prove what hath been ſaid, by a better au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, recourſe muſt be had unto more Authentick Monuments, and to ſuch as bear not the marks of Forgery, as theſe Canons do. The firſt of theſe Monuments which preſents it ſelf unto our ſight, is the third Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> aſſembled <hi>Anno</hi> 397. for in one of its Canons which is the 37. of the Code of the Church of <hi>Africa,</hi> it makes this Decree, <hi>That in the Sacraments,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Concil. Carthag. 3. can. 24.</note> (or as <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin de Braga</hi> reads it in his Collection) <hi>that in the Sanctuary nothing elſe be offered but the body and blood of our Lord, as our Saviour hath taught; that is to ſay, Bread, and Wine mingled with Water:</hi> and to diſtinguiſh this Oblation which related unto the Euchariſt, from the others offered by the faithful people, the Council adds, <hi>As for the firſt-fruits, whether it be Honey, or Milk, let them be offered after the uſual manner, upon ſome ſolemn day for the myſtery of Infants; and if theſe things, eſpecially the Milk, be offered at the Altar, yet let them receive their particular bleſſing, to diſtinguiſh them from the conſecration of the Body and Blood of our Lord; and as to firſt-fruits, that nothing be offered but Grapes and Wheat. Martin</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Braga</hi> in his Collection of Canons, hath expreſſed in theſe words, that of the Council of <hi>Carthage; There ought nothing to be offered in the Sanctuary,
<note place="margin">Collect can. c. 55.</note> but the Bread and Wine which are bleſſed in Type or in Figure, of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And the fourth Council of <hi>Orleans Anno</hi> 541. makes this decree, <hi>That none preſume to offer in the Oblation of the holy Cup ought elſe but the fruit of the Vine mingled with Water;</hi>

<pb n="34" facs="tcp:47504:46"/>made this Decree, which <hi>Gratian</hi> and others ignorantly alledge as a fragment of a Letter of Pope <hi>Julius</hi> unto the <hi>Egyptians.
<note place="margin">Concil. 3. Bracar. c. 1. al. 2.</note> We have been informed that certain Perſons puffed up with a Schiſmatical ambition, do offer Milk inſtead of Wine at the Holy Offertory contrary to the command of God, and contrary to the inſtitution of the Apoſtles: and that there be others which do not offer at the Sacrament of the Cup of our Lord, the Wine preſſed out, but they communicate the people with Grapes which have been offered:</hi> and having alledged againſt this abuſe, the Authority and Example of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> theſe Fathers add, <hi>That they ſhould therefore forbear offering Milk at the Sacrifice, becauſe the manifeſt and evident Example of the Evangelical truth hath appeared, the which permits only that Bread and Wine ſhould be offered.</hi> This was alſo the method of the VI. <hi>Oecumenical,</hi> Council when it tranſcribes in the 32. Canon, that which hath been above alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Synod of <hi>Carthage,</hi> and in tranſcribing they appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate it unto themſelves, and make it their own. But if any ask the reaſon of this proceeding of the Fathers, I mean where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they thought fit to diſtinguiſh the Oblation of the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt from all other things, which in all likelihood were promiſcuouſly offered at the ſame time with theſe things, becauſe theſe kinds of charitable Oblations had not for their ſcope the celebration of the Sacrament only: I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, that by reaſon of the ſilence of Antient Writers, it is very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to anſwer diſtinctly this queſtion; yet I will nevertheleſs thereupon offer my conjectures: I ſay then in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Fathers have thus done in honour and reſpect unto the Sacrament, imagining that it was very juſt and reaſonable that this Bread and Wine which by conſecration were to be made the efficacious and Divine Symbols of the Body and blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſhould not be offered conjunctly with other things which indeed were to be applyed unto pious uſes, but leſs noble and conſiderable; and methinks the Fathers of the Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> give us ſufficient ground to conclude ſo from their Decree. <hi>Secondly,</hi> I think that having made this diſtinction, they provided ſome other way for the maintenance of Church-men, and for the relief of the Poor; and ſo there being nothing elſe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but for the Sacrament, the holy Fathers judged fit to limit the Oblations only to the ſpecies of Bread and Wine, the two only things neceſſary for the celebration of the Divine Myſtery. Whereunto poſſibly it might be added, that by this wiſe conduct they would prevent a growing ſuperſtition; the multitude being but too much inclined to abuſe the moſt innocent ceremonies, being always ſenſual and carnal, they might imagin that the Oblations made at the Altar, being called Firſt-fruits, were of the ſame kind
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:47504:46"/>with the firſt-fruits of the Law, whereof the Oblation ſanctified the whole Lump; ſo that the Fruits of the Earth might not be lawfully uſed until the firſt-fruits had been firſt offered unto God upon the holy Table, as if, without this Sanctification, the uſe had been unlawful: I cannot ſee but it may be ſo inferr'd from the words of <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who ſpeaking of the Oblation which the Church makes of the Symbols of the Body and Blood of the Lord, ſaith, <hi>That it ſanctifieth the whole Lump by the firſt-fruits.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Theod. in Pſalm 109.</note> And what renders this conjecture the more probable, is, what S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> obſerved,

                     <hi>That many amongſt the Chriſtians carried ſundry ſorts of meat unto the Monuments of Martyrs, and after Prayers they carried them to their Houſes, ate of them, and gave Alms, with an opinion that they were ſanctified by the merits of the Martyrs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now 'tis high time to enquire what was the form of the Bread which was offered for the Celebration of the <hi>Euchariſt.</hi> The Apoſtle S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies in the tenth Chapter of the firſt to the <hi>Corinthians, That we are all partakers of one Bread:</hi> This makes me think that they of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered upon the holy Table a Loaf, greater or leſs, according to the number of Communicants; the unity of this Loaf repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the unity of the Myſtical Body of Chriſt: and this Loaf was broken into pieces, to give a ſhare unto each Communicant. The Author of the Letter unto the <hi>Philadelphians,</hi> under the name of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> gives us no leave to doubt of it; for we therein read theſe words, <hi>There is one only Bread broke unto all:</hi>

<note place="margin">Concil. 16. Tolet c. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>It is come unto the knowledge of our Aſſembly, that in ſome part of</hi> Spain, <hi>certain Prieſts, either through ignorance, or impudent temerity, do not offer upon the Lord's Table Loaves of Bread fitted and prepared on purpoſe, but as each one is thereto enclined by neceſſity, or carried by inclination, they raiſe haſtily and in a round form little Cruſts of Bread, intended for their particular uſe, and offer them at the Altar, with Water and Wine, for an holy Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation:</hi> and thereupon having alledged the Texts of three Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, and of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the Council doth thus determine; <hi>In fine, what we can collect, is, That taking a whole Loaf, he brake it, and bleſſed it, and gave it by Parcels unto each of his Diſciples, to ſhew us to do the like for time to come, and without doubt to ſignifie that each morſel is Bread, but that all Bread is not a Morſel; whence it is that he ſaith in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words, pointing at him that was to betray him,</hi> Unto whom I ſhall give the Sop, he it is; <hi>therefore ſeeing the words of our Redeemer ſhew that he took a whole Loaf, and not a morſel, and that he gave it by parcels unto his Diſciples, in breaking it after having bleſſed it; and alſo ſeeing the Apoſtle St.</hi> Paul <hi>mentions that he took Bread and broke it, giving Thanks,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is it not to teach us that we ſhould take a whole Loaf, and ſet it upon the Lords Table to be Bleſſed, and not a piece of Bread, ſeeing that our Lord did not ſo? for if man be careful with affection to employ all the diligence he can poſſible for preſerving his Life, how much more care and exactneſs ought he to ſhew for the purity which ought to be obſerved in the ſervice of God? therefore deſiring to ſet bounds unto this temerity or ignorance, we have with a full conſent thought fit that the Bread ſet upon
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:47504:47"/>the Table of the Lord, to be ſanctified by the Miniſterial Benediction, ſhould be an entire clean and whole Loaf prepared for that purpoſe.</hi> Afterwards the Fathers do recommend the uſe of midling Oblations, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, as I conjecture, that the quantity of Bread ſhould be propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the number of Communicants, to the end that what remains, ſay they, may the better be kept; or if it be eaten, that it ſhould not incommode the Stomach by its quantity and weight, and that it may appear that 'tis intended rather to feed the Soul than the Body. It may therefore eaſily be conceived that theſe midling Oblations, mentioned by the Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> are ſo called in reference to the number of Communicants which were to participate of the holy Sacrament, unto whom the Bread of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for the Communion was to be proportioned, and that they ſhould not be made too big, fearing leſt it ſhould be thought that more regard was had unto the matter of the Sacrament than unto the Virtue, and to feeding the Body by digeſtion, than to ſtrengthening the Soul by Heavenly and Spiritual Nouriſhment. Yet, nevertheleſs this Decree be very good for the time wherein it was made, and doth clearly juſtifie what we have ſaid touching the nature and form of the Bread which Chriſtians were accuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to uſe in the celebration of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> I cannot find that there happened any other alteration, until at laſt in the Eleventh Century they began in ſome Churches in the Weſt to change the form and quality of the Bread which had been always uſed in this Sacrament, uſing inſtead of it <hi>little Hoſts, like Wafers, round and white, and very thin and ſlender:</hi> Whereof the Interpreter of the Roman Order, who lived towards the end of the Eleventh Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, of whom we have already ſpoke, makes great complaints,

<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 62.</note> and very well verſed in the Traditions of the Church, ſaith thereupon ſeveral other things; it appears that he had much adoe to ſuffer, that in his time in ſome Churches, the Oblations of Bread, which by an ancient cuſtom of the Church were offered by the faithful people upon the Lords Table, for the uſe of the Sacrifice, were reduced unto the form of a Crown-Piece, and a ſlight ſlender ſubſtance, much different from the form of true Bread;
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:47504:48"/>therefore it is that by contempt they call them ſlender Wafers made in the form of pieces of Money, which we call Crowns; they attribute unto them an imaginary ſhadowy lightneſs, and affirm they do not deſerve the name of Bread, they are ſo thin; and that by reaſon of them, Divine Service, and the Religion of Eccleſiaſtical Offices, doth receive in all reſpects very great Damage, and inveighs againſt them in ſundry other ſharp and harſh ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, all which things I have not thought fit here to recite.</hi> But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this learned Interpreter of the Roman Order could ſay or do, he could not hinder but that the uſe of theſe Wafers was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the whole extent of the Latin Church; and that alſo ſome other Chriſtians, who hold no Communion with the Latin Church, have held and retained it amongſt them, although in other things they declare themſelves to be contrary unto her, both in Doctrine and Worſhip: But yet things reſted not there; for inſtead of Bread in the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> offered by Believers, or at leaſt, Flower, whereof it was made, they obliged the people to offer pieces of Money, as <hi>Honorius</hi> of <hi>Autun</hi> (who lived in the Twelfth or Thirteenth Centuries) doth inform us: his words deſerve to be here inſerted;

                     <hi>It is ſaid, that antiently the Prieſt received Flower from each houſe or Family, which is ſtill practiſed by the Greeks, and that they made thereof the Bread of the Lord, which they offered for the People, and diſtributed it amongſt them, after it was conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; for all thoſe which offered Flower aſſiſted at Maſs, and it was ſaid for them in the Canon;</hi> of all thoſe which are here preſent which offer unto thee this Sacrifice of praiſe; <hi>but after the Church was increaſed in number, and decreaſed in holineſs, it was decreed by reaſon of carnal Men, that thoſe that could, ſhould communicate every Lords day, or every third Sunday, or on great Feſtival days, or three times a year; and by reaſon of the Peoples ſeldom communicating, it was not needful to make ſo great a Loaf, it was ordered, that it ſhould be made in the form of a piece of Money, and that the People ſhould offer pieces of Money inſtead of Meal;</hi> which is to this time practiſed in the whole Communion of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> I have inlarged upon this cuſtom, and have made no difficulty to examine it from firſt to laſt; becauſe that the change happened in this cuſtom, ſeems to me of great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er importance than many imagine; for men are not uſually inclined unto the changes of this Nature, without ſome weighty reaſons; it muſt needs be that thoſe which have chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the form, the conſiſtence, and the quality of the Euchariſt, have been thereunto induced for ſome great deſign: there be ſome which think that the motive (there ſoon following it ſuch change in the Doctrine) was nothing elſe but a deſign to remove and baniſh from the mind and thoughts of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants,
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:47504:48"/>that that, which was received by the hand at the Lords Table, and was put into the mouth, was Bread; to which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, ſay they, theſe Wafers were very fit, which were preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto them, or rather were put into their Mouths, ſeeing they have neither the form nor Figure of true Bread, and that never any People or Nation in the World, uſed this kind of food; and what doth the more confirm them in this belief is, that this change hapned not as they ſuppoſe untill after the condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Berengar (viz.)</hi> towards the end of the XI.

                  </argument>
                  <p>AFTER Jeſus Chriſt had taken the Bread and the Cup, the Evangeliſts obſerve that he gave thanks, that is, that he Bleſſed and Conſecrated them; the Church that imitated him in the firſt Action, hath alſo done the like in the ſecond, although in proceſs of time ſhe hath added di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Ceremonies which were not therein at firſt: but becauſe the Conſecration contains ſeveral things, as the place where it is done, the matter of Chalices and Patins, the Language, the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and the Form of Conſecrating, that is to ſay, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrating Liturgy; theſe things muſt be examined in Order, to avoid obſcurity and confuſion. In this Chapter I deſign to treat of the Place of Conſecration, and of the Matter of Chalices. As to the Place, it is to be conſidered either generally or particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: in the former ſenſe it was the place where Chriſtians aſſembled together for the worſhip of Almighty God, wherein they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed their exerciſe of Piety and Devotion, and wherein for a long time they eat altogether: for in the ſame place wherein they made their <hi>Agapae,</hi> and where they took theſe Love-feaſts, they alſo did celebrate the Sacrament; and indeed all generally agree, that the Primitive Chriſtians did frequently eat in common,
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:47504:49"/>every one contributing as they were able, unto theſe Feaſts, unto which the Poor had as free acceſs as the Rich, although they were not able to joyn their portion unto their Brethren. S. <hi>Paul</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains himſelf clearly,
<note place="margin">1 Cor 11.</note> when he ſaith unto the Believers of <hi>Corinth; When you meet together, this is not to eat the Supper of the Lord; for each one haſteth to eat his own Supper, and one is hungry, and another is drunken, What have you not houſes to eat and to drink in? or do you deſpiſe the houſe of God, and ſhame them which have not?</hi> It is alſo granted that the Euchariſt was celebrated at the ſame Times and Places where the Chriſtians made theſe meals together; and therefore it is the Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>eating the Supper of the Lord,</hi> backing the cenſure which he pronounced againſt the <hi>Corinthians</hi> by reaſon of diſorders and exceſſes which they committed in theſe Feaſts of Charity, with the Hiſtory of the Inſtitution of the Sacrament, which he recites at large; an undoubted proof that this Sacrament was celebrated in the Time, and at the Places where Believers did eat together. S. <hi>Luke</hi> makes it appear evidently, when ſpeaking of the firſt Chriſtians of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 2.42.</note> he ſaith, <hi>That they all did perſevere in the Doctrine and Communion of the Apoſtles,

Century; but becauſe there were great abuſes crept into theſe Feaſts, the Council of <hi>Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicea</hi> aſſembled about the year of our Lord 360. was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to forbid the uſe of them in the Temples and Churches; <hi>You muſt forbear</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>making the Agapae in the Temples,
<note place="margin">Concil. Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. cap. 28.</note> or of ſetting up Tables, and eating in the houſe of God.</hi> It appears by what hath been ſaid, that for the moſt part, the place where the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt was celebrated and conſecrated, was the place where Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers met together to ſerve God, and where for a long time they made their Feaſts of Charity, even at the ſame time that they celebrated the Sacrament. It is true thoſe places were very different according to the diverſity of ſtates and conditions where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Church of Chriſt was; at the firſt beginning of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, they aſſembled in private houſes, ſometimes in one place, ſometimes in another; in private and obſcure places to be ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, as well from the rage of the <hi>Jews,</hi> as the fury of the <hi>Gentiles:</hi> therefore it was that they aſſembled before day, and in the night time; and they continued ſo to do for a long time, whileſt the Church was harraſſed with Perſecutions, and becauſe that ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they aſſembled together at the Tombs of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> they alſo there celebrated the Euchariſt; at leaſt the Pontifical Book obſerves in the life of <hi>Felix</hi> the firſt, towards the end of the III. Century, that this Pope decreed, <hi>That Maſſes ſhould be celebrated upon the Sepulchres of Martyrs;</hi> which by the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> is called <hi>a Sacrifice of Thanksgiving,</hi> in his diſcourſe unto the Aſſembly of Saints, or to the Church of God; becauſe in celebrating the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thanks were given unto God for the Victories of <hi>Martyrs,</hi> as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpeaketh, who makes mention of this ſame cuſtom in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:47504:50"/>the laſt Chapter of the VIII. Book <hi>De Civit. Dei.</hi> Yet it muſt not be imagined, but that during theſe ſad and troubleſome times, they had ſome fixed places deſtinated for their Exerciſes; for there were ſufficient intermiſſions, during the which they built, certain little Houſes joyning to their Church-yards, which were places diſtant from the ſight of Men, where by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence they aſſembled with greater ſafety. The Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory of <hi>Euſebius</hi> doth teſtifie ſo much, and in ſeveral places mentions thoſe places where Chriſtians were wont to aſſemble; obſerving that before the perſecution of <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> they had ſome intermiſſions under certain Emperours, during which they atempted ſome better and larger Buildings, than thoſe which they had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. But God would humble his Church, which went about to loſe amongſt <hi>Lilies,</hi> the beauty which ſhe had acquired amongſt <hi>Thorns:</hi> he ſtirred up this cruel Emperour, who, by the firſt Edict he made to be publiſhed againſt Chriſtians the 19. year of his Reign, commanded to be demoliſhed and deſtroyed to the ground their Oratories and Churches, which continued untill <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> imbraced the Chriſtian Religion. For then the Church breathing quietly under a Prince which cheriſht her, and gratify'd her in all that could be deſired; Chriſtians were ſeen ſtriving who could ſurpaſs each other in building magnificent and beautiful Churches and Temples, which were ſo many illuſtrious Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Reſt and Plenty which they enjoyed under the firſt Chriſtian Emperour.</p>
                  <p>Having conſidered the Places wherein Chriſtians aſſembled themſelves but by relation unto the Celebration of the Sacrament, I have not amply treated the Queſtion of Temples or Churches; and I have ſo done the rather, becauſe an occaſion of examining it more at large may in ſome ſhort time offer it ſelf. I only ſay that it was in the IV. Century that they began to be conſecrated, but after a manner intirely different from that at this time uſed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Latins;</hi> and that it was about the ſame time prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were made of celebrating the Sacrament only in conſecrated places. This general conſideration of the place where Chriſtians aſſembled, and where they celebrated their Sacrament, may give us ſome light to deſign the particular place where the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration was made: whileſt they aſſembled in private houſes, there is no queſtion to be made, but that they placed in ſome convenient place in the Chamber, a Table whereupon they did conſecrate the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt, and where they diſtributed the holy Communion unto Believers: the example of Jeſus Chriſt ſerved them inſtead of a Law, for he celebrated his Euchariſt in the ſame place where he had eaten the paſchal Lamb,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:47504:50"/>there he conſecrated and diſtributed it, neither the Evangeliſts nor S. <hi>Paul</hi> having ſaid any thing that may make us think other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. Moreover, the Roman Catholicks and the Proteſtants confeſs, that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> did celebrate the Euchariſt in the ſame place where they made their Love-feaſts; and if there be any conteſts, I do not ſay betwixt Communion and Communion, but betwixt particular Doctors in each of both Communions; it is not in regard of the place, but in reſpect of the time, to wit, whether the Sacrament was celebrated before the <hi>Agapae,</hi> or afterwards, which doth not relate to the Subject we now treat of: ſeeing then that the <hi>Corinthians</hi> made their Feaſts of Charity, and made alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether theſe Feaſts upon Tables, or at leaſt on things that ſerved to that purpoſe, methinks it cannot be at all queſtioned, but that they did celebrate and alſo conſecrate their Euchariſt upon the ſame Table, ſeeing they did celebrate it in the ſame place and at the ſame time where they did eat together. S. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> in the Account of this Sacrament which he hath left us, hath not mentioned the place where this Conſecration was made: but to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the innocency of thoſe times, and the manner of conſecrating the Symbols which he repreſents unto us, one cannot but conclude, but that it was upon a Table that they conſecrated them, after that the people had preſented them unto the Paſſover, as he ſaith; the word [Supper] uſed by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> directed them unto this uſe and practice, as well as the example of Jeſus Chriſt:
<note place="margin">Origen. l. 20. c. 2.</note> For as S. <hi>Iſidore</hi> of <hi>Sevill</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is called a Supper from the Communion of thoſe which eat;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. t. 5. homil. 21.</note> whereunto alſo doth amount what S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> obſerved before him. <hi>That the Apoſtle calleth the Supper of the Lord that, of which all, that are invited, do participate in common, and with love.</hi> For thoſe expreſſions do import a Holy and Divine repaſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon unto all the faithful, and which requires a Table to take it, and to eat of it altogether: when therefore Chriſtians had places deſtinated for the exerciſe of their holy Religion, it is evident there was a certain place where this Euchariſtical Table was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, there to conſecrate this auguſt Sacrament, and there to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribute it unto all the faithful Communicants. And when under <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, the Temples of Chriſtians began to be Stately and Magnificent, there was a particular place called the Sanctuary, where the myſtical Table was ſet, whereupon Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration was made.

Nevertheleſs it is certain there is nothing more frequent in the writings of the Fathers than the name of <hi>Altar,</hi> to deſign the place of Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and of celebrating the Euchariſt; yet I judge that the firſt place of Antiquity where the Altar is mentioned, is (if my me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory fail me not) in the Book of Prayer made by <hi>Tertullian.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:47504:53"/>of Churches.

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Language uſed at Conſecration, and wherein Service was generally performed.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>HAving conſidered the place of Conſecration, and the Veſſels uſed about this Ceremony, the order which we propoſed to follow, requires that in this Chapter we treat of the Language which was uſed in the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Sacrament, and generally in the whole Divine Service. When <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> conſecrated and bleſſed the Bread and Wine, it was in the Language of the Country which he ſpake always during his living in the Fleſh, and during the courſe of his Miniſtry; otherwiſe he could not have been under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the People, whom he intended to inſtruct and bring unto his Knowledge and Communion. And this Language was not pure <hi>Hebrew</hi> after the return of the <hi>Babyloniſh</hi> Captivity, as it was before, at the time of our Saviours coming into the World, but was a corrupt <hi>Hebrew,</hi> and altered and mixt with <hi>Chaldee,</hi> and <hi>Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riack;</hi> eſpecially the latter: ſo that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Language at that time was compoſed as much of <hi>Syriack</hi> as of the <hi>Hebrew.</hi> It was then in that Language which was compoſed of two Languages, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour conſecrated and celebrated his Euchariſt, having even retained ſome expreſſions which the Father of the Family was wont to uſe amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> at the time of celebrating the Paſſover. The Apoſtles did religiouſly follow the example of their Maſter who beſtowed not upon them the gift of Tongues meerly for convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the World, but alſo that they might preach the Goſpel, admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the Sacraments, and in a word exerciſe all the other functi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their Divine and glorious Miniſtry, in the Language of each Nation and People where his Providence ſhould ſend them; this is ſo evident a truth, that there is no Chriſtian never ſo little reaſonable but will believe it; but if any the leaſt doubt reſts upon him in this matter, I doubt not but he will overcome it eaſily, if he takes the pains to read what the Apoſtle hath left written of this Doctrine in the 14. Chap. of the 1. Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> as all the antient Commentators, Greek and Latin, St. <hi>Chryſoſtom, Theodoret,</hi> the Greek chain of <hi>Oecumenius, Theophylact, Hilary</hi> a Deacon of <hi>Rome, Pelagius, Primaſius, Sedulius;</hi> Secondly the Tranſlation of the Holy Bible into all Languages ſhews very clearly,

It is true, ſay the Proteſtants, that whilſt the uſe of the Latin Tongue ſubſiſted in the Weſt, and that that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage was common and frequent unto the Nations of the Weſtern Empire, there were a great many Latin Tranſlations of the Bible; but when the uſe of that Language ceaſed, it was neceſſary to tranſlate it into other Languages for the edification of the people, and Nations which there inhabited, as it had been tranſlated elſewhere into <hi>Greek,</hi> and <hi>Syriack,</hi> and generally into all Languages uſed by all the Nations in the World. Now it is very difficult, ſay they, to imagine, that care could be taken to make all theſe Verſions in the Vulgar Tongues, if at the ſame time the people had been obliged to ſerve God in an unknown Tongue. Beſides, may a man ſay, I would deſire to know wherefore the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Fathers have ſo frequently and carefully recommended the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Scriptures unto the people, if it had not been tranſlated into their Language? It is credible, yea certain, that the exhortations which are to be found in the works of S. <hi>Jerom</hi> and S. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> only for injoining the reading of them, would make a juſt Volume; and what need ſo many exhortations to read it, but only that by ſo doing, People might learn to ſerve God after a right manner?</p>
                  <p>But we muſt make a ſtricter inquiry into the Celebration of the Euchariſt, and the whole Divine Service, to know more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly if it were performed, as hath been ſaid, in a Language under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by the People: All men will agree, if I miſtake not, that Prayers, Invocation, and giving praiſes unto God, are the eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial parts of the Worſhip and Service of God; now <hi>Origen</hi> in his excellent work againſt <hi>Celſus,</hi> doth formally declare, that every Nation did praiſe and pray unto God in their own Language.

                  <p>We may add unto all that hath been ſpoken, the practice of the moſt conſiderable Chriſtian Communions, which at this time do celebrate Divine Service in the Vulgar Tongue underſtood by the People, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Abaſſins</hi> throughout <hi>Preſter John</hi>'s Country; the <hi>Moſcovites</hi> and <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> the <hi>Armenians,</hi> as is teſtified by the Frier <hi>Alvarez,</hi> the Baron <hi>Sigiſmund, James de Vitry,</hi> and ſeveral others; the <hi>Liburnians,</hi> the <hi>Illyrians</hi> or <hi>Sclavonians,</hi> as is obſerved by <hi>Aven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> and <hi>John Baptiſta Palat.</hi> Citizen of <hi>Rome,</hi> in his Treatiſe of the manner of Writing.

As for the <hi>Greek</hi> Church which is of a vaſt extent; it is moſt certain they celebrate Divine Service in pure Greek, and not in the vulgar Greek now ſpoken, which hath much degenerated from the Antient Greek; but thereunto two things are replyed: firſt that the Corruption hapned unto the Language of the <hi>Greeks</hi> under the Tyranny of the <hi>Turks,</hi> is arrived but of late days; ſo that before that time, the Greek Church celebrated all their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Service in a Language underſtood by the People. Secondly that how great ſoever this Corruption is, it could not hinder but the <hi>Greeks</hi> in the decay of their Language which arrived by little and little, and by degrees, but that they were inſtructed from Father to Son in the underſtanding of the antient Liturgies of St. <hi>Baſil</hi> and of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> which they make uſe of; and that by that means notwithſtanding the alteration befaln their Language, they underſtand the things therein expreſſed. Therefore the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple make at this preſent the ſame Anſwers which they did here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; the 123. Conſtitution of the Emperor <hi>Jovinian</hi> who lived in the VI. Century may take place in this matter of the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage underſtood by the people in Divine Service; for he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands that they ſhould with a loud voice repeat the Prayers made in the Celebration of the Euchariſt, and in the adminiſtration of Baptiſm, to the end the people might underſtand it, and grounds his Decree upon what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith in the fourteenth Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians.</hi> But, in fine, if any now demand the reaſon wherefore the Latin Church which could and ought to celebrate Divine Service in the Latin Tongue during the time that Language was commonly uſed amongſt the People in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> and wherefore they ſhould obſtinately perſiſt in doing it in the ſame Language, although for ſeveral Ages it hath been of no uſe amongſt theſe Nations, excepting in the Schools; and wherefore they Anathematiſe in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> thoſe which ſay,

But in fine, the Elements being ſo brought and laid upon the Holy Table to be conſecrated, theſe ſame Liturgies inform us, that he that officiates, after having recited all the Hiſtory of the Inſtitution of the Sacrament, deſires of God that
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:47504:62"/>he would ſend upon this Bread and Wine which were offered unto him, his Holy Spirit, to make them the Body and Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and becauſe the Author of the <hi>Apoſtolical</hi> Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were not written until the end of the third Century, or the beginning of the fourth, doth very clearly repreſent the manner of this Conſecration, we will begin with him, to ſhew how this conſecrating Liturgy was couched; for after having ended the recital of the Hiſtory of the Euchariſt by theſe words,
<note place="margin">Conſtitut. Apoſtol. l. 8. cap. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>Do this in remembrance of me, for as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink this Cup, ye ſhew the Lords death till he come:</hi> He goes on, <hi>Therefore ſetting before us his Paſſion, his Death, and Reſurrection, his aſcenſion into Heaven, and his ſecond coming, which will be when he comes with power and glory to judge the quick and the dead, and to reward everyone after their works; We effer unto thee O our King and our God according so thy Commandment, this Bread and this Cup, in giving thee thanks by him, becauſe thou haſt made us worthy to ſtand in thy preſence to execute this Miniſtry; and we beſeech thee O God, who ſtandeſt in need of nothing, that thou wouldeſt favourably behold theſe gifts which are preſented before thee, and that thou wouldeſt therein do thy good pleaſure for the honour of thy Chriſt, and that thou wouldeſt ſend thy Holy Spirit upon this Sacrifice, the witneſs of the paſſion of the Lord Jeſus, to make this Bread the Body of thy Chriſt, and this Cup his Blood; to the end that thoſe which partake of them may be confirmed in piety, obtain remiſſion of ſins, may be delivered from the temptations of the Devil, filled with the Holy Ghoſt, made worthy of thy Chriſt, and of everlaſting life when thou, O Lord moſt mighty, ſhalt be reconciled unto them.</hi> In the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy of St. <hi>James</hi> it is ſaid, <hi>O Lord ſend thine Holy Spirit upon us,

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:47504:63"/>thouſand years. And to the end this truth ſhould be made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt, this queſtion muſt be throughly examined, to wit, whether the Antients did conſecrate by Prayers and Invocations, and by thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings, or otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> the abſolute Maſter of the Chriſtian Religion, did conſecrate his Sacrament by Prayers, Bleſſing and Thankſgiving, as the Divine Writers do teſtifie, making uſe of two expreſſions; the one of which ſignifying, giving of Thanks; and the other to Bleſs, as to their Etymology, but as to their ſence and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they ſignifie one and the ſame thing. The reaſon where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may be, that it was the manner of the <hi>Jews</hi> to conceive their Prayers, in terms of Praiſe and Bleſſing; the firſt Chriſtians which made the example of Chriſt, their Law and Rule, intended not to conſecrate any otherwiſe than he himſelf had done: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſpeaks of Prayers which the Paſtour made after having received the Bread and Wine mingled with Water which was preſented unto him;

But the Latins being earneſt, and deſiring to have our conſent in writing, touching this Article, the Emperor ſo ordered the matter, that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of</hi> Nice <hi>ſhould repeat theſe matters before the Pope; ſome of our men being alſo preſent, as if they had been come from the whole Aſſembly of the Greeks, which being written by the Latins, were publiſhed in all their Provinces, which was done by force and ſurpriſe, and contrary unto our knowledge: ſee here with what ſincerity, what advice, liberty and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord things were carried.</hi> It was then after this manner things paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed at <hi>Florence,</hi> upon the Article of the manner of conſecrating of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> which makes good what we have ſaid, That the Greek Church hath retained unto this day, the cuſtom of conſecrating by Prayers and Supplications. Let us now, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſſume our diſcourſe, ſay, That if ſome of the antient Doctors of the Church made the Conſecration of the Symboles depend on the pronouncing of theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> it is of the number of thoſe which have declared in favour of the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration by Prayer, as for Inſtance, St. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> and ſome others with him; and in this caſe, that they ſhould not jar amongſt themſelves, it may be ſaid they have not attributed the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration unto theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> but as unto words de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring what was before befaln: unto the Bread and Wine of
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:47504:67"/>the <hi>Euchariſt:</hi> for it is often ſaid that a thing is done, when it is declared that it hath been done; or it may alſo be ſaid, That they conſidered theſe words as containing a promiſe of God, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he tacitly accompanies with his Bleſſing and his Grace the Prayers which are addreſſed unto him for the Conſecration of the Sacrament. But if the Fathers who attributed the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration unto theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> are not of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of thoſe who have already declared in favour of a Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration by the vertue of Prayer, of neceſſity their thoughts muſt be interpreted after the manner as hath been ſaid, or freely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that they have digreſſed from the common Road, and that ſo their teſtimonies are not to be received nor allowed againſt ſo conſtant and ſo univerſal a tradition. For in theſe rencounters we ought to follow the advice given unto us by <hi>Vincentius Lerinenſis,
<note place="margin">Common.</note> If ſometimes the different opinion of one, or a few more, that are deceived, riſe up, and thwart the received opinion of all, or of a greater number of Catholicks, the raſhneſs of one, or of a few, ought to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, in the firſt place, by the general Decrees of an univerſal Council, if there be any: in the ſecond place, if there be none, That the Opinion of ſeveral great Doctors be followed, who agree together:</hi> For, as he ſaith a little after,

                  <p>But that nothing might be wanting unto this Obſervation, and that we may the better underſtand the nature of this Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the great conſequence of it, let us compare the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration of <hi>Pagans,</hi> unto that of Chriſtians, for many times theſe ſorts of Compariſons do tend very much to the clearing of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in queſtion.

Wherefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> told them in his Apology, <hi>Theſe
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:47504:67"/>Images are of the ſame matter with our Pans and Kettles,
<note place="margin">Apol. c. 12.

Age, <hi>John Belet</hi> who lived as 'tis ſaid, in the ſame time; <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, <hi>Honorius</hi> of <hi>Autun,</hi> and <hi>Durandus de Mende,</hi> who wrote in the XII. and XIII. and <hi>Gabriel Biel</hi> who compoſed the Leſſons in the XV. with this difference that ſome amongſt them have added that the Bread upon which the Shepherds pronounced the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental words, was converted into fleſh, and as for them they were deſtroyed by fire from Heaven. Nevertheleſs they own, as well as <hi>Caſſander</hi> in his Treatiſe of Liturgies, that before that time theſe words were pronounced with a loud voice: Now let the Reader judge if the Latins had reaſon for a motive of this Nature to aboliſh the antient cuſtome contrary to what is even unto this day practiſed amongſt the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Syrians,</hi> the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thiopians,</hi> the <hi>Armenians,</hi> the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> or <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> which do all conſecrate with a loud voice. I know there have been ſome Doctors of the Latin Church, who to render more antient the cuſtom of conſecrating with a low voice, have had recourſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſpiritual Meadow of <hi>John Moſchus</hi> who lived in the VII.

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Oblation, or of the manner of the Sacrifice.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IF Chriſtians had done no more in the Celebration of their Sacrament, than <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had done in his, the Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Symbols had immediately been followed with the breaking of Bread, and ſo we ſhould have been obliged to have treated of the breaking of Bread after having examined the form of Conſecration: but becauſe betwixt the Conſecration and the breaking Bread which immediately followed, they have in proceſs of time brought in the Oblation and Elevation, before we treat of the Fraction, we muſt conſider theſe two other things, the former in this Chapter, and the other in that which next follows. As our Saviour after Prayer and giving Thanks whereby he conſecrated the Sacrament, proceeded unto the breaking of Bread, and diſtribution, there appearing nothing in the Hiſtory of the Inſtitution of any Oblation or Elevation, betwixt the Conſecration and the breaking of the Bread: ſo the Apoſtles who exactly followed his Example and Precepts, certainly failed not to do what he had done, I mean to proceed unto the breaking the Bread, and the diſtribution of it immediately after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving bleſſed and ſanctified it; which ſimplicity was very pleaſing unto thoſe who lived in the following Age. For <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> doth teſtifie that the Conſecration of the Symbols was followed by the Communion of Believers, which neceſſarily preſuppoſed the break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Bread, therefore he forbore expreſſing it at large. But their Succeſſors, thinking they ought to raiſe and advance the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this Myſtery, and to elevate the ſimplicity of it, with di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Ceremonies, to render it the more pleaſing unto the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> which they earneſtly deſired to draw unto the Communion of the Goſpel, and of the knowledge of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> joyned unto the Conſecration of Symbols the Oblation which they made unto God after they had been bleſſed and ſanctified. Oblation, which was a kind of Sacrifice, taking the word in a large ſenſe, and by conſequence an improper ſenſe, they judged of very great importance to work upon the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles;</hi> becauſe both the one and the other being accuſtomed unto outward Sacrifices, were exceedingly ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalized that the Chriſtians made uſe of none in their Religion: This appears by the calumnies which they caſt
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:47504:70"/>upon thoſe who firſt undertook to defend the innocency of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity againſt their reproaches. But the better to underſtand the nature of this Oblation, it is to be obſerved there are three ſeveral ſorts to be ſeen in the Liturgies of Chriſtians: the firſt, the moſt antient, and that which was only in uſe in <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s time, and afterwards, is the Oblation of Bread and Wine which the faithful made in the Celebration of the Euchariſt, and which the Miniſter offered unto God by Prayers, as may be ſeen in all the Liturgies. That attributed unto St. <hi>James</hi> ſhall ſerve at this time, becauſe the ſame in ſubſtance is to be found in all the reſt; there the Paſtor makes this Prayer unto God:
<note place="margin">Liturg. S. Jacob.</note> 
                     <hi>Caſt thine Eyes, O God, upon us, and upon this reaſonable ſervice, which we offer unto thee, and receive them as thou didſt the Oblations of</hi> Abel, <hi>the Sacrifices of</hi> Noah, <hi>the Prieſthoods of</hi> Moſes <hi>and</hi> Aaron, <hi>the peaceable offerings of</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel, <hi>the repentance of</hi> David, <hi>the Incenſe of</hi> Zacharias: <hi>to the end that as thou receivedſt from the hand of thine Apoſtles this true worſhip, thou alſo of thy goodneſs wouldeſt receive of us who are ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, theſe gifts which we offer unto thee: Grant that our Oblation may be agreeable, being ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, for the propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation of our Sins, and of thoſe which the People have committed through ignorance.</hi> This action of the faithful people offering the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt for the Divine Service, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led not only Oblation, but alſo Sacrifice, as we have ſhewn in examining whence the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt were taken.
<note place="margin">Cypr. de oper. &amp; E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leemoſ.</note> And in fine, St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth poſitively call this Action a Sacrifice in that place of his formerly alledged. When the Oblations are ſet upon the Altar, or upon the Holy Table to be bleſſed, they are again offered unto God by Prayer, as hath been ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the foregoing Chapter: but becauſe that in ſome ſort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates unto this firſt Oblation whereof we ſpeak, I would ſeek for the ſecond in the Oblation made unto God of theſe ſame Oblations at the very inſtant of time that they are conſecrated: for we have ſeen that the Author of the Apoſtolical Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<note place="margin">Conſtit. Apoſt. l. 8. c. 12.</note> at that inſtant addreſſes this Prayer unto God: <hi>We offer unto thee, O our God and our King, this Bread and this Cup, giving thee thanks by</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>becauſe thou haſt counted us worthy to appear in thy ſight, and to execute the Prieſthood, and we beſeech thee, O God, who haſt need of nothing, to behold theſe Oblations with a favourable eye which are ſet before thee, that thou wouldeſt accept them for the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of thy Son, and that thou wouldeſt ſend the Holy Ghoſt upon this Sacrifice,</hi> &amp;c. It is very likely they did after this manner, thinking that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> who began the Celebration of his Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt with Prayer, made a kind of Oblation unto God of the Bread and Wine, and ſhewed at the ſame time his willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:47504:70"/>of ſacrificing himſelf ſoon after, for the expiation of the Sins of the World; therefore it is, as I conceive, that they grounded the Oblation, whereof we treat, wherein they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired of God that he would ſanctifie unto them the uſe of theſe two things, and that he would by his bleſſing make them the efficacious and Divine Sacraments of the Body bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the Blood ſhed, of his Chriſt, for the Salvation and conſolation of their Souls. From hence it is that St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> in one of his Epiſtles ſaith in ſundry places, that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> offered Bread and Wine in the Sacrament; that we offer Wine, and that Wine ought to be offered in the Cup of the Lord, and not only ſo, but that the Lord therein offered himſelf, having in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood regard unto the diſpoſition wherein he ſhewed himſelf to be, of expoſing himſelf unto death for us, when he inſtituted the Sacrament and memorial of it.
<note place="margin">Cyprian. Ep. 63.</note> 
                     <hi>Our Lord</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>offered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf firſt unto his Father, and commanded it ſhould be ſo done in remembrance of him; ſo that the Sacrificer which imitates what</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>hath done, doth truly ſupply the place of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. As for the third and laſt of the Oblations which I mentioned to be practiſed by Chriſtians, it was done after the Conſecration of the Symbols, after which they offered them unto God; whereunto relates the warning made unto the People in the Apoſtolical Conſtitutions;
<note place="margin">Conſt. Apoſt. l. 8. c. 13.</note> 
                     <hi>To pray unto God by</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>for the gift offered unto our Lord, to the end that he would receive it as an odour of a ſweet ſavour, upon his Heavenly Altar, through the interceſſion of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. In the Liturgy of St. <hi>James</hi> alſo,
<note place="margin">Liturg. S. Jacob.</note> 
                     <hi>They pray for the gifts which have been offered and ſanctified, to the end God would accept them, and receiving them upon his Heavenly Altar, as a ſweet and ſpiritual ſavour, he would in their ſtead ſend his Heavenly grace and the gift of his Holy Spirit;</hi> and a little after they alſo pray, <hi>That becauſe he hath received as an odour of ſweet ſavour,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> the Oblations and Preſents which have been offered, and hath been pleaſed to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie and conſecrate them by the grace of his Chriſt, and the coming of the Holy Ghoſt, he would alſo ſanctifie their Souls, their Spirits, and Bodies,</hi> &amp;c. in that of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom, We offer unto thee of thy goods;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Liturg. Chryſ. Germ. Theor. p 403.</note> or as <hi>Germain</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> explains it, <hi>We offer unto thee the Antitypes?</hi> It is true, that conſidering the manner of the <hi>Greeks</hi> conſecrating, this Oblation ſhould immediately precede the Prayer whereby they pretend to conſecrate; but if the <hi>Latins</hi> are conſidered, this Oblation is not made unto God, until after the Conſecration be ended. But there is ſeen in this Liturgy, for the Oblation whereof we treat, the ſame as in that of St. <hi>James.</hi> In fine, in all the Liturgies which we have, although they be not all made by the Authors in whoſe names they paſs, the Oblation
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:47504:71"/>which is made unto God after the conſecrating Liturgy of the <hi>Latins,</hi> is an Oblation (as is expreſly ſaid) <hi>of Bread and Wine, of Gifts and Fruits of the Earth.</hi> But of all the Liturgies there is none that better informs us of the nature of this Oblation than that which is uſed by the Latin Church, which thus ſpeaks unto God;
<note place="margin">Miſſa Can.</note> 
                     <hi>We offer unto thy glorious Majeſty, of thy Gifts, and of thy Preſents, a holy and immaculate Hoſt, the Holy Bread of Life, and the Cup of Eternal health; upon which things we beſeech thee to look with a favourable and propitious Eye, and to accept them, as thou wert pleaſed to accept the Preſents of thy righteous Son</hi> Abel, <hi>and the Sacrifice of our Patriarch</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the Holy Sacrifice, the immaculate Hoſt, which thy Sovereign high Prieſt</hi> Melchiſedeck <hi>of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto thee; we humbly beſeech thee, O Almighty Lord God, to command that theſe things might be carried by thy Holy Angel, upon thy high Altar, into the preſence of thy Divine Majeſty.</hi> And a little after, continuing the like diſcourſe, they ſay unto God, <hi>By the which</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>O Lord, thou haſt made all theſe things for us, thou ſanctifieſt, bleſſeſt, and beſtoweſt them upon us.</hi> From whence it is that the Holy Fathers meditating upon this latter Oblation, and conſidering that the Bread and Wine was the matter of it, they ſpake, as near as I can gueſs, of the Sacrifice of the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Church, as of a Sacrifice of Bread and Wine, and although they have not all expreſſed themſelves after one manner, yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs their expreſſions however they ſeem to differ in words, yet tend to the ſame ſenſe, and contain one and the ſame Doctrine: ſome inſtead of ſaying that there is offered Bread and Wine unto God, have ſaid, that there were offered un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him the firſt-fruits of his Creatures, (that is to ſay) things which he gives us for our nouriſhment;

                  <p>But beſides the reaſons which moved the holy Fathers to call the Sacrament a Sacrifice, there be ſeveral others, which it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to examine, that it might evidently appear what was the
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:47504:73"/>nature and form of this Sacrifice amongſt them. And firſt, I find that they conſidered the Euchariſt as a memorial of the Sacrifice of the Croſs; and becauſe for the moſt part, memorials do take their name from the thing whereof they be memorials, they have made no difficulty to call it a Sacrifice, as indeed this name may very fitly be given unto it; and not only the name of a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice; but even of a true Propitiatory Sacrifice, becauſe it is the memorial of one that is truly ſuch: It is in this proſpect they have called it <hi>the Paſſion;
<note place="margin">Cyprian Ep. 63.</note> the Sacrifice which we offer,</hi> ſaith S. <hi>Cyprian, is the paſſion of our Lord:</hi> But this is to be obſerved, <hi>that we make men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Paſſion of our Lord in all the Sacrifices.</hi> Thereby in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner confounding the death of our Lord, with the commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which we make of it in the Sacrament, by reaſon of the near relation which there is betwixt the Memorial, and the thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the remembrance is renewed.

<pb n="89" facs="tcp:47504:73"/>Eulogius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> contemporary and friend unto <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt, followed the others ſteps, when he ſaid,

                     <hi>That the Sacrament which we celebrate, is not an oblation of divers Sacrifices, but the commemoration of the Sacrifice which was once offered.</hi> The ſame language was uſed in the Ninth Century, ſeeing that <hi>Bertram</hi> or <hi>Ratramn</hi> ſaid; <hi>That the Oblation which</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>once offered,

<note place="margin">Lombard. l. 4. ſentent. diſt. 12. litt. g.</note> 
                     <hi>That is called a Sacrifice and Oblation which is offered and conſecrated by the Prieſt, becauſe it is the memorial and repreſentation of the true Sacrifice; and of the holy immolation which was made upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of the Croſs.</hi> And <hi>Thomas Aquinas</hi> in the Thirteenth Century; <hi>That the Celebration of the Euchariſt,
<note place="margin">Thom. ſunn part. 3. q. 83. part. 1.</note> is called the immolation of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>becauſe, as S.</hi> Auſtin <hi>ſaith unto</hi> Simplicius, <hi>the Images are wont to take their name from thoſe things whereof they be Images; and that the Celebration of this Sacrament, is a certain repreſentative type of the death of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>which is his true immolation; therefore the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Sacrament is called Immolation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the Euchariſt being an act of our duty towards God, and towards his Son, for the admirable and ineffable benefit of his Death, the antient Doctors might alſo in this regard, call it by the name of Euchariſtical Sacrifice, of Thankſgiving, of Prayer, and of Acknowledgement. This in appearance was the meaning of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> when he ſaid,
<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in Matth. Hom. 26.</note> 
                     <hi>That the venerable Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are called Euchariſt, becauſe they are a commemoration of ſundry benefits, and becauſe they diſpoſe us always to render thanks unto God.</hi> And becauſe God is honoured with two very different qualities, one of Creator, the other of Redeemer; we give him thanks, that as Creator, he gives unto us the Fruits of the Earth, and we then conſecrate unto him the Bread and Wine as the Firſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruits of his Creatures: and that in quality of Redeemer, he hath given unto us the Body and Blood of his Son, and in this
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:47504:74"/>regard we conſecrate unto him the Bread and Wine, as Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials of the bloody death of our Saviour. St. <hi>Ireneus</hi> obſerves this uſe as to the firſt regard;
<note place="margin">Iren. l. 4. cap. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>We are obliged</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to make our offerings unto God, and that in all things we ſhould be thankful unto the Creator, but that muſt be done with pure affections, and with a ſincere Faith, a firm hope, and ardent Charity; in offering unto him the Firſt fruits of his Creatures, which are his; but it is only the Church which offers unto God this pure Oblation, preſenting unto him, with Prayers, of the Creatures which he hath made.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> (if I be not deceived) intended to touch the latter regard, when ſpeaking of the Sacrifice of the Croſs,
<note place="margin">Auguſt. l. 20. contr.

<note place="margin">Juſt. Mart. dialog. contr.

                  <p>From this ſame Fountain, proceeds another Doctrine of theſe firſt Conducters of the Chriſtian Churches, which conſiſts in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructing Believers, and teaching them what had ſucceeded unto the Sacrifices of the Law. I do not find after an exact ſcrutiny, that they alledge or inſiſt upon the Sacrament, but they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to oppoſe unto the <hi>Moſaical</hi> Sacrifices, either the Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Sacrifices which we offer unto God under the Goſpel, or the truly propitiatory Sacrifice of the Croſs, or both of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In regard of the former, the Author of the Apoſtolical Conſtitutions,
<note place="margin">Conſt. Apoſt. l. 2. c. 25.</note> ſaid, <hi>That unto the Sacrifices of the Law, ſucceeded prayers, vows, and giving of thanks; and that the Firſt fruits, Tythes,

<note place="margin">Id. l. 6. c. 23.</note> 
                     <hi>That inſtead of Sacrifices which were made by ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of blood,</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>hath given to us a reaſonable Sacrifice, My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical and unbloody, which is celebrated in remembrance of his death, by the Symbols of his Body and Blood:</hi> In which words indeed he makes mention of the Euchariſt, but as of a Myſtical and Spiritual Sacrifice, and in the ſame ſenſe which he ſaid, <hi>That our Sacrifices at preſent are prayers, and giving of thanks. Origen</hi> in all his <hi>Homilies</hi> upon <hi>Leviticus,</hi> doth very exactly after his manner, ſeek for all the myſtical ſignifications of the ancient Sacrifices; but I do not find that he doth once ſpeak of a propitiatory Sacrifice offered every day unto God by Chriſtians.

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the Elevation and breaking the Bread.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WE have Obſerved in the beginning of the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Chapter, that although <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had broke the Bread preſently after having Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and Conſecrated it, without any other Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony intervening betwixt the Conſecration and Fraction; nevertheleſs the ancient Chriſtians in proceſs of time, introduced ſome other Ceremonies betwixt theſe two actions, which were not uſed at the beginning. I mean the Oblation of the Symbols and the Elevation. Having then treated of the former, which is of the Oblation, and diſcovered by that means, all the Motives and Reaſons which obliged the holy Fathers to give unto the Euchariſt the name of Sacrifice, and how they explained themſelves upon the quality and nature of this Sacrifice: Now we muſt conſider the Elevation, which followed the Oblation, but not very ſuddainly. It is moſt certain, that our Saviour made no Elevation, when he Inſtituted and Celebrated his firſt Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; for none of the Evangeliſts have made any mention of it; the Chriſtians which followed in the next immediate Age, pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed no ſuch thing, as appears by the relation made unto us by S. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> of all that was practiſed in that time, in celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Auguſt Sacrament; the Liturgies of this Divine My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, which may be ſeen in the Conſtitutions which paſs in the Apoſtles name, in the Writings of the pretended <hi>Denys</hi> the <hi>Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opagite,</hi> and in S. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>'s <hi>Myſtagogicks,</hi> do make no men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this Elevation: So that for four or five Ages of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we do not find that this Ceremony was practiſed. But if we do not find the Elevation of the Euchariſt mentioned in the Liturgies of the four or five firſt Ages of the Church, we do therein find another practice very conformable unto the ſtate of the Goſpel, and unto the nature of the Sacrament, I mean the lifting up the mind and heart, as S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth expreſly teach us; <hi>The Prieſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>before reciting the Lords Prayer, by a Preface, doth prepare the Spirits of the Faithful,</hi> ſaying, <hi>Lift up your hearts,
<note place="margin">Cyprian. de. Orat Dom.</note> that the people being warned, in anſwering, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nto thee O Lord! ſhould think only of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt. An Advertiſement found in all the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies which have been ſince made, and alſo even in that of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Church. As for the Elevation of the Sacrament, there is ſome mention made of it in the Liturgy, which goes in the name of
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:47504:80"/>S. <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tab. Chrono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. p. 536, 537.</note> but cannot be his, as the Learned of both Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions acknowledge; Therefore thoſe who compoſed the Office of the holy Sacrament, attribute it unto <hi>John</hi> the Second, who was alſo Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> but near 200. years after Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that is, towards the end of the VI. Century. And I do not conceive that this Elevation appeared before that time; ſo that if it be to be found in any Liturgy which bears the name of any ancienter Authour, for inſtance, in that attributed unto S. <hi>James,</hi> I ſcarce make any doubt but it was forged, or at leaſt altered or corrupted. But it is nothing to know that after the four or five firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, they begun in ſome Churches to uſe the Elevation of the Sacrament, if we do not alſo conſider for what end they did elevate it; that is, either to oblige the people to adore it; or for ſome other reaſon. The firſt that I can find who explained the cauſe and reaſon of this Elevation, was <hi>German</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in his Theory of Eccleſiaſtical things, where he very curiouſly inquires the myſtical reaſons of what was practiſed in the Church, and particularly, in the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of Divine Myſteries; a Treatiſe which moſt Authors at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute unto <hi>German</hi> who lived in the VIII. Century, and ſome unto another of the ſame name, who was <hi>Patriarch</hi> in the XII. After all, the Author of this Theory, being come unto the Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Elevation, crept into the Church about the VI. Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, doth ſufficiently give to underſtand, that it intended not the adoration of the Sacrament, but only to repreſent the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our Saviour upon the Croſs,
<note place="margin">Germ. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinop. in Theor. t. 12. Bibl. Patr. p. 407.</note> and that was its lawful and genuine uſe and end. <hi>The Elevation of the pretious body</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>repreſents unto us the Elevation on the Croſs, the Death of our Lord upon the Croſs, and his Reſurrection alſo.</hi> As for the Latins, the firſt that I remember, who bethought himſelf of finding out a My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery in the ſame Elevation, was <hi>Ives</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi> at the end of the XI. Century; but all the Myſtery that he therein found, was no more than had been found by this Patriarch of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> near 300. years before him; <hi>When the Bread and the Cup</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are lifted up by the Miniſtry of the Deacon,
<note place="margin">Ivo Carnenſ. Ep. de Sacrif. Miſſ. t. 2. Bibl. Patr. p. 602.</note> there is Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration made of the lifting up of the Body of Chriſt upon the Croſs:</hi> And as this is the firſt among the Latins, who in the Elevation of the Sacrament, hath diſcovered the Myſtery of the Elevation of our Lord upon the Croſs, ſo alſo is he the firſt of the Latin Church (if I miſtake not) who hath writ of this Elevation; for there is no mention of it, neither in S. <hi>Gregory,</hi> nor in S. <hi>Iſidore</hi> of <hi>Sevil,</hi> who both flouriſhed in the beginning of the VII. Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; nor in <hi>Amalarius Fortunatus,</hi> nor in <hi>Rabunus,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Mayence,</hi> nor in <hi>Walafridus Strabo,</hi> nor in the pretended <hi>Alcuin,</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:47504:80"/>Authors partly of the IX. and partly of the X. Century, although they all of them wrote of Divine Offices, and indeavoured to diſcover the Myſtical ſignifications of all things practiſed in Religion in their times, and eſpecially in the Sacrament; unleſs it were <hi>Gregrory</hi> the firſt, who only left a Liturgy for the Celebration of the Sacrament. Its true that at the end of <hi>Rabanus</hi> his firſt Book of the Inſtitution of Clerks, there is ſeen a Fragment by way of ſupplement, wherein mention is made of the Elevation whereof we treat, but againſt the truth of the Manuſcripts, wherein this Fragment is not to be found, beſides what the thing it ſelf evidently declares, that this Famous <hi>Prelate</hi> was not the Author of it. Moreover, the Author, whoſoever he was, with <hi>German</hi> and <hi>Ives</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi> refers the Elevation he mentions, unto the Elevation of the Body of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> upon the Croſs; <hi>The Elevation of the Body and Blood of</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>by the Prieſt,

                     <hi>That it is not certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly known when the lifting up the Hoſt was joyned unto the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration in the Latin Church;</hi> and rejects the Opinion of <hi>Durandus,</hi> who maintained it had never been ſeparated from it; and he proves his by the ſilence of the Writers above mentioned, unto whom he joyns the Author of the <hi>Micrologue,</hi> who lived by every bodies confeſſion, in the XI. Century, and the Roman Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which ſome ſuppoſe was writ at the ſame time: And he ſaith, that both theſe ſpeak of the Elevation of the Oblation,
<note place="margin">Ord. Rom. t. 10. Bibl. patr. p. 15.</note> which is true as to the <hi>Micrologue;</hi> but as for the Roman Order, it indeed makes mention of the Elevation of the Cup by the Deacon; for as for the Elevation of the Hoſt (that is to ſay) the conſecrated Bread, by the Biſhop,
<note place="margin">Goar ubi ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pra.</note> I find no mention thereof in the whole Book: howſoever <hi>Goar</hi> gives to be underſtood, that the Elevation ſpoken of by theſe two Authors, tended not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Adoration, when he obſerves, that it was not joyned unto Conſecration, but that it was made at the end of the Canon very near the Lords Prayer. <hi>Hugh Maynard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hug. Menard. in Sacram. Greg. p. 373, 374, 375.</note> a Benedictine Fry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er explains himſelf ſo fully in his Notes upon <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, in his Book of Sacraments, that nothing more can be ſaid than
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:47504:81"/>what he hath written. <hi>Now</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the Latin Church, as ſoon as the Bread and Wine is conſecrated, they are lifted up, that the people there preſent, might adore them; which practice I do not judge to be antient, ſeeing there is no mention thereof to be found in our Books of the Sacraments, Printed, nor Written, nor in</hi> Pamelius, <hi>nor in the Roman Order, nor in</hi> Alcuin, Amalarius, Walafridus, Rabanus, <hi>who have fully explained the Order of the Maſs; nor in the</hi> Micrologue, <hi>who hath alſo very exactly laboured in the ſame Subject.</hi> Afterwards this learned Fryer obſerves, that it is clearer than the Sun at Noon day, if the XV. Chapter of the Author of the <hi>Micrologue</hi> be conſidered, who would not have failed to have writ of this Ceremony had it been uſed in his time, (that is in the XI. Century) becauſe he makes mention of lifting up the Bread and the Cup together before the Lords Prayer, which alſo appears more at large in the twenty third Chapter of the ſame Treatiſe; Nevertheleſs he excepts the <hi>Mozarabick</hi> Office, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mention is made of two Elevations of the Hoſt, one of which is made preſently after Conſecration, and the other after theſe words, <hi>Let us declare with the Mouth what we believe with the Heart,</hi> but at the ſame time he ſaith by Parentheſis <hi>(if no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hath been added)</hi> and to ſay the truth, there is great likely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that it is an addition made ſince the introducing into the Latin Church, the cuſtom of lifting up the Hoſt immediately after Conſecration, that it might be adored by the people, ſeeing there is no mention of lifting up the Sacrament in the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Church, before the XI. Century; as for the <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Church he confeſſeth, that they elevated the Sacrament, but after the Lords Prayer, and ſome other Prayers, at the very inſtant of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating, and he proves it by the Liturgies of St. <hi>James,</hi> St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,</hi> by <hi>Anaſtaſius</hi> the <hi>Sinaite,</hi> by <hi>George Codin,</hi> and by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the life of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> attributed unto <hi>Amphilochius,</hi> but which in all likelihood was not his, and he obſerves that the Chriſtians of <hi>Ethiopia</hi> practiſe the ſame Ceremony, which is quite different from the Elevation of the Latin Church, it being only done to call the People to the Communion, in ſaying, <hi>Holy things are for the Saints;</hi> and not to have them adore the Euchariſt, as amongſt the Latins. Therefore it is, that whereas the Elevation of the Latin Church is joyned immediately after Conſecration, which according to their belief, changing the Bread and Wine into the ſubſtance of the Body and blood of Chriſt, renders that which that he celebrates holds in his hands, an Object of Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Adoration, whereunto thoſe which be preſent are invited by the elevating the Hoſt preſently after it is conſecrated. That of the Greek Church was not done till a good while af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:47504:81"/>Conſecration, and as they were ready to communicate; ſo that the intent of it was only to call Believers to the participation of the Sacrament But <hi>Maynard</hi> reſts not there he anſwers as <hi>Goar</hi> doth, thoſe which wreſt ſome words of the Eccleſiaſtical Hierarchy under the name of <hi>Denys</hi> the <hi>Areopagite,</hi> to prove that in his time, there was an Elevation of the Sacrament joined unto Conſecration in the Greek Church, and he very judiciouſly obſerves, that this pretended <hi>Denys</hi> ſpeaks only of a Ceremony obſerved amongſt the Greeks, which is, that they kept the Divine Symboles hid and covered until the very inſtant of communicating; and that then they were unco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to be ſhewed to the people, to have them come to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Table in ſhewing them: and although the Author but now mentioned ſpeaks of this action, yet there is not to be found any Elevation of the Hoſt preſently after Conſecration in any of the Greek Liturgies. I will add unto all this one thing very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, which is, That it appears by the antient cuſtoms of the Monaſtery of <hi>Cluny,</hi> written about the end of the eleventh Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, That even to that time the Elevation was not practiſed in the extent of the Latin Church, not ſo much as that at firſt mentioned by <hi>Ives</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi>

For in the thirtieth Chapter of the ſecond Book of theſe cuſtoms of the Congregation of <hi>Cluny</hi> is exactly, not to ſay ſcrupulouſly, ſhewn all that was then practiſed in this famous Monaſtery; nevertheleſs there is not one word ſaid of the Elevation of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> only that 'tis obſerved in one place, That when he that celebrates, ſaith, <hi>throughout all Ages,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 143.</note> &amp;c. the Deacon lifteth up the Cup alittle; it may eaſily be ſeen, this little raiſing the Cup is nothing like the Elevation which we examine, and that it was a little Ceremony, quite different from what is at preſent called Elevation. But if any ask me at what time they began in the Latin Church to turn the Elevation, made in ſeveral parts of the Weſt to repreſent the Elevation of our Lord on the Croſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the adoration of the Sacrament, practiſed after the Eleventh Century: I affirm, That <hi>William Durand,</hi> towards the end of the Thirteenth Century, was the firſt, as far as I can diſcover, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred Adoration to the Elevation of the Hoſt, in his Rational of Divine Offices; for amongſt ſeveral reaſons of this Elevation, he alledges this laſt,

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:47504:82"/>alſo in this Thirteenth Century that <hi>Honorius</hi> the Third, and <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gory</hi> the Ninth, made their Conſtitutions for adoring the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after Elevation, as ſhall be ſhewn in the third part of this Treatiſe, where we are to diſcourſe of the Worſhip, and by conſequence examine the queſtion of Adoration. In the mean time it is not amiſs to obſerve, that before any Elevation of the Sacrament was practiſed in the Weſt, <hi>Berengarius</hi> was ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in the World, and his followers were diſperſed into all parts in great abundance; and the <hi>Albigenſes</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> which ſoon followed him, had ſeparated themſelves from the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the Latin Church a great while before the Adoration of the Hoſt, and the Elevation therewith enjoyned: and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence there have always been Chriſtians in the Weſt, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver practiſed Elevation nor Adoration in their <hi>Euchariſt;</hi> not to inſtance Chriſtian Communions in the Eaſt, and elſewhere, which likewiſe never practiſed it.</p>
                  <p>After Elevation comes the fraction, which in the Sacrament of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and in that of the primitive Chriſtians, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately followed. For the holy Writers teſtifie, That the Lord had no ſooner bleſſed the Bread, but he brake it to diſtribute it; and becauſe the Hebrews Loaves were flat and ſpread round, and ſomething long, like our Cakes and Biskets, and for that reaſon were eaſily broken, without any need of a Knife to cut them, therefore the holy Scripture ſtill mentions the breaking of Bread, and not cutting Bread; it is therefore not to be queſtioned, but the Lord in celebrating his Supper made uſe of that ſort of Bread; and broke it after the manner of the Jews, to diſtribute it to his Diſciples. Nevertheleſs ſeeing the Apoſtle St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves of the Bread of the <hi>Euchariſt,</hi> that we break it, <hi>The Bread which we break,</hi> and that the Lord, explaining this Myſtery, ſaith poſitively of the Bread, <hi>That it is his Body broken for us,</hi> he would teach us that this fraction of Bread is neither ſuperfluous, nor uſeleſs, but that it makes part of the Sacrament, and that it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in repreſents unto us the ſufferings of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> particularly thoſe of his Croſs; it was the ſignification which <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed therein in his Dialogues,
<note place="margin">Theod. Dial. 3. p. 147.</note> when he ſaith, O. <hi>Remember what the Lord took and broke, and by what name he called that which he had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi> E. <hi>I will ſpeak myſtically, by reaſon of thoſe which are not initi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated;</hi> (he means that he will not name the Bread.) <hi>After that he had taken and broke it, and diſtributed it to his Diſciples, he ſaid,</hi> This is my Body which is given for you, <hi>or which is broken, according to the Apoſtle; and again,</hi> This is my Blood of the New Teſtament, which is ſhed for many. O. <hi>He makes no mention then of the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity in ſhewing the Type of that Paſſion?</hi> E. <hi>Not any.</hi> O. <hi>But of the
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:47504:82"/>Body and Blood?</hi> E. <hi>It is true.</hi> O <hi>The body then was Crucified.</hi> And ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable <hi>Bede,
<note place="margin">Bede in Marc. c. 14.</note> He himſelf broke the Bread which he preſented unto his Diſciples, that he might ſhew the fraction of his Body.</hi> Alſo it is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all doubt that Chriſtians carefully obſerved this Ceremony, for they conſecrated a Loaf greater or leſs, according to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Communicants, which was divided into ſeveral Morſels, to be diſtributed unto each Communicant; all the Liturgies that are extant, true or falſe, teſtifie this fraction, and all the holy Fathers confirm it. Accordingly we read in the life of Pope <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius,</hi> who held the Chair towards the end of the Seventh Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, That he ordained that at the breaking the Bread of the Lord,

So it is practiſed by the Greeks, the Moſcovites, the Ruſſians, and the Abaſſins; for they make a Loaf of Bread greater or leſs, either in breadth or thickneſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

As for the Latin Church, this cuſtom of breaking the Bread into little pieces, to be diſtributed unto each of the Communicants, was practiſed therein until the Twelfth Century, as we have ſeen at large: And this manner of ſpeech was ſo frequent, that although they have aboliſhed the action which had introduced it,

                  </argument>
                  <p>IN the Celebration of the Sacrament, the breaking of Bread ſhould be followed by the Diſtribution; but becauſe the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtribution contains ſeveral things under its compaſs, as the Time, the Place, the Poſture of the Communicant the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which diſtribute it, thoſe which receive, with the words both of the one and the other; and in fine, the Things diſtributed, and received; it is abſolutely neceſſary to examine them ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, to give the more light unto this part of the outward form of the Celebration of the Sacrament. Therefore we will reſt ſatisfied to conſider in this Chapter, the Time, the Place, with the Poſture, and Geſture of the Communicant. As for the Time, there's no body can make any doubt, but that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute and celebrate the Sacrament of the Euchariſt after the Supper of the Paſſeover, and at the end of the Supper; the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts do witneſs it, and expreſs themſelves ſo fully, as that they give us not the leaſt cauſe to doubt of it; which makes me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the Apoſtles, and the Churches founded by their Preaching, practiſed the ſame during life. And to ſay the truth, it ſeems to be plainly found in the Eleventh Chapter of the firſt Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that the Belivers of that Church, did celebrate this Divine Myſterie, and participate thereof, after having eaten altogether; ſo that the Celebration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was as it were the Seal, the Crown, and accompliſhment of thoſe <hi>Agapes, and Feaſts of Charity;</hi> I know that all be not of this Opinion, and I do not intend to cenſure thoſe who judge that the Celebration of the Sacrament was performed before the <hi>Agape.</hi> I will only ſay, that it is the Judgment of many Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men, which they ground upon the following Reaſons, which I am obliged to recite, that the Reader might judge of their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity. In the firſt place it appears, that the deſign of theſe firſt Chriſtians, was exactly to imitate the Order that was obſerved by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> who, as we ſaid, celebrated his Euchariſt after Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:47504:84"/>Secondly,
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.21.</note> They pretend that the Apoſtle gives an evident proof of it, when he ſaith, <hi>That ſome advanceth and taketh his own ſupper before, without ſtaying for the reſt;</hi> for that could not be if they had begun with the Celebration of the Sacrament, and end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Feaſt of Charity, it being unlikely, that the Sacrament would be ſolemnized before the Aſſembly was compleat, and that all which were accuſtomed to be preſent, were come. In the third place, had it been practiſed otherwiſe, they think S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhould not have had ſo great cauſe to have charged the <hi>Corinthians</hi> of having <hi>received the Bread and the Cup of the Lord unworthily;</hi> nor to command them to examine themſelves before they come unto the Lords Table, becauſe by this reckoning, the diſorder he charges them with, ſhould have happened after the Celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sacrament, and not before. So that the Apoſtle ſhould only have had cauſe to blame the diſorder of their Feaſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mingling therewith any diſcourſe of the Sacrament; yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, he doth the quite contrary; for he inſiſts much more upon the Sacrament, than upon all the reſt; which doth evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſhew, that theſe firſt Chriſtians aſſembled for their Feaſts of Charity, began this Solemnity by the common Meal which they made all together, and did end it by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt, whereof they did communicate, after they had ended Supper, after which the company was diſmiſſed. Unto all theſe proofs, they add the marks of that ancient Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, which remained in the V. Century. <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith in ſome of his Works, <hi>That the Euchariſt was celebrated at ſupper time;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tertul. de corona, c. 3.</note> as <hi>Rigaut,</hi> and <hi>Rhenanus</hi> confeſs upon the place. But although that the practice of celebrating it alſo in the Morning, was already very frequent in the Church; I cannot ſee how it can be conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from the words of this Learned <hi>African,</hi> that the Celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made after the Meal, rather than before, no more than by what is obſerved by S. <hi>Cyprian</hi> about forty years after, for diſputing againſt thoſe who celebrated the Sacrament in the Morning with Water, and urging them with the Example of our Lord, who did his with Wine, he ſaid,
<note place="margin">Cypr. Ep. 63.</note> that they happily imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to be quit, under colour, <hi>That at Supper, Wine was offered in the Cup.</hi> All that can be inferr'd from theſe two paſſages of Antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is, That in thoſe times, the Euchariſt was celebrated con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jointly with the <hi>Agapes,</hi> or Feaſts of Charity; but in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that it was alſo very frequently celebrated, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly in the Morning, and by conſequence, faſting. Alſo is it not therein, the marks of the ancient cuſtom before mentioned are ſought; as alſo in what is ſaid by S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> in the beginning of the V. Century;
<note place="margin">Aug. Ep. 118. c. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>That ſome were wont to receive the Sacrament after Meal

                     <note place="margin">Concil. Carth. 3. c 29.</note> as is expreſly obſerved by the Third Council of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage,</hi> aſſembled at the ſame time, ordering that this Sacrament ſhould alwaies be celebrated faſting, excepting only the day that our Lord's Supper is celebrated; that is to ſay, the day whereon Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration is made every year, of the Supper of our Lord, which is, as every body knows, upon <hi>Holy Thurſday.</hi> But as this Rule would ſerve as a Law only in <hi>Africa;</hi> there were other Churches which uſed thus, not on that day preciſely, but every week, on <hi>Saturday.</hi> And indeed two ancient Church Hiſtorians, <hi>Socrates</hi> and <hi>Sozomen,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Socr. l. 5. c. 21. &amp; Grac. 22. Sozom. l. 7. c. 19.</note> who wrote ſome years after the death of S. <hi>Auſtir,</hi> inform us, That the Chriſtians of <hi>Egypt,</hi> thoſe of <hi>Thebais,</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Alexandria;</hi> in ſeveral Cities and Villages, did celebrate and receive the Sacrament <hi>Saturday</hi> at Evening, after having ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped together.

                  <p>The Place where the Diſtribution of the Sacrament was made, was for the moſt part the place of meeting or where the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly was made; but to conſider it more particularly, it was the place where the Myſtical Table ſtood, unto which the faithful People drew near to Communicate. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> diſtributed the Sacrament to his Apoſtles, at the ſame Table where he eat the Paſchal Lamb with them, and where he celebrated the whole Ceremony of this antient <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Feaſt.

                  <p>As for the Poſture and Geſture of the Communicant, which is the laſt circumſtance we intend to examine in this Chapter, it is certain that when the Lord diſtributed his Euchariſt unto his Diſciples, they were almoſt lying along, that is, leaning a little
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:47504:87"/>one upon another, becauſe that was the manner of eating at that time amongſt the <hi>Jews</hi> and other <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Nations, and that the Diſciples changed not their poſture in receiving the Sacrament, but continued in the ſame poſture they were in during the Supper of the Paſſover. And becauſe St. <hi>John,</hi> the beloved Diſciple, leaned on the Body of our Lord <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> the Scripture men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that he lay on his breaſt at the Table, or leaned on his boſom; the Chriſtians of the following Age, drew near and approached unto the holy Table preſently after Conſecration, there to receive the ſacred Symbols of their redemption, as may be gathered from <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi>'s Liturgy, where we do not ſee any Ceremony, nor any kneeling practiſed by the Communicants in participating of this Divine Myſtery, only, that going before unto the Communion, they gave unto each other the kiſs of Charity, in token of their Love and Union, whereof this venerable Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to be a more ſtrict tye; and from hence it is, that in all the Liturgies, the faithful are warned to kiſs each other, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they appear at the Lords Table, although this warning is given in ſome ſooner, in others later, but in all, it is before the Communion; in thoſe very Liturgies which we have remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we do not find any alteration to have hapned in the poſture of the Communicant: For after having ſhewed the Sacrament unto the people, and invited them unto the Communion by theſe words, <hi>Holy things are for the Holy,</hi> each Believer draws near, with the motions and deſires of Piety and Devotion which he ought to have, to partake worthily of this Divine Sacrament. <hi>Denys</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria</hi> gives ſufficiently to underſtand,

Century, the Adoration of the Sacrament was eſtabliſhed in the Latin Church; for this bowing of the Body, which St. <hi>Cyrill</hi> deſires, is not properly the poſture of him who really doth adore; becauſe he which adores, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates himſelf on his knees before the Object of his Adoration, to ſhew the motions of the profound humility of his Soul, and his ſelf-denial before him, unto whom, by this action he confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, that he is but duſt and aſhes.

But it is needleſs to inſiſt any longer on a matter ſo clear, and, beſides, which is not of the greateſt moment: therefore 'tis ſufficient to know, that at the beginning of Chriſtianity the Deacons gave both Symbols unto the Communicants; that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards they adminiſtred but the Cup only, he which celebrated, giving the Bread: although this cuſtom was not ſo ſoon admitted in all parts, there being ſome places, where the Deacons in the IV.

                  <p>As for the perſons admitted unto the Communion, they were Believers, therefore the Deacons made the Catechumeni, the Energoumeni, the penitents, and generally all ſuch as were not initiated in the Myſteries of Chriſtian Religion, to go out, and thoſe people were not only not ſuffered to participate of the Sacrament, but they were not ſuffered to ſtay in the Aſſembly, when it was celebrated. Indeed, that they were not ſuffered to aſſiſt at the Celebration of the Sacrament, was not alwaies pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd amongſt Chriſtians, ſeeing that it is moſt certain, that in the two firſt Centuries, and probably a good part of the third, they hid not their Myſteries, and did not celebrate with the Doors ſhut, as appears by the Works of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> which ſhews plainly, that the Liturgies which go in the name of S. <hi>James,</hi> and S. <hi>Mark,</hi> are forgeries; for therein is mention of excluding theſe ſorts of perſons above mentioned, the Deacon
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:47504:91"/>making them go out before the beginning of Conſecrating the Divine Symbols, which is alſo to be read in all the other Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies; and I ſhall not ſtand to prove this matter, being indiſputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and owned by all the World, the truth whereof is eaſily to be ſeen by ſuch as pleaſe to read the Liturgies which we have remaining, and which by the care taken therein by the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons, to ſhut out the Catechumeni, the Energoumeni, the peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, and the uninitiated, do manifeſtly ſhew, that they have been made ſince the third Century, whatever care the Authors of ſome of them have taken, to ſhroud themſelves under the name of ſome Apoſtle, or Diſciple of the Apoſtles. And if only Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livers were obliged to Communicate, this obligation regarded them all in general; for the Penitents were not thought to be Believers during the time of their penance; the ſins they had committed, and for which they had been cenſured to undergo the burden of this penance, having made them fall from this priviledge and happy ſtate; when I ſpeak of Believers, I do not mean only ſuch as were grown up, and ſuch as were of years of diſcretion, but alſo Children. Therefore we are neceſſarily inga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to make two Conſiderations of the perſons of Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants; the firſt ſhall treat of the Communion of Adults, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, that of Children. As for the Communion of perſons of Age, and years of diſcretion, there is no queſtion to be made, but they were all obliged to Communicate when they were preſent in the Aſſemblies where the Sacrament was Celebrated; and if they neglected,
<note place="margin">Chryſoſt.

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:47504:92"/>and zeal of Chriſtians was very much abated, we do not find that they ever approved to celebrate the Sacrament without Communicants; on the contrary, the Councils, and thoſe which have written of Divine Offices, do not own any celebration to be lawful, without there are ſome to communicate with the Prieſt who officiates. In that ſenſe is to be underſtood what is ſaid by <hi>Walafridus Strabo,

                     <hi>That no Prieſt dare preſume to celebrate Maſſes, unleſs there are two perſons preſent, and that he make a third, becauſe he ſaith in the plural, The Lord be with you, and Pray for me.</hi> Now it appears, that this Doctrine is grounded upon the prayers of the Liturgies being publick, and having for their object, not one or two Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons only, but all the Faithful in general, who ought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate; alſo all the Liturgies, Ancient and Modern, and all thoſe who have commented upon them, give ſufficiently to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, that they have been all compoſed, and written in behalf of Communicants, without whom they were ſo far from cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the Sacrament, that <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> tells us, That it was ſent unto thoſe who were abſent: which ſheweth, they looked upon the Sacrament, as a Seal and Pledge of the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on amongſt Believers.

                     <note place="margin">Concil. Lao<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dic. c. 58.</note> forbids it to be celebrated in private Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes; this Divine Sacrament being appointed in nature of a Sacrament of Communion, for the benefit of all Chriſtians. Therefore it is,
<note place="margin">Conſtit. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol. l. 8. c. 13.</note> that the Author of Apoſtolical Conſtitutions, mentioning the Perſons who ought to communicate, and in what manner, he comprehends generally all faithful Chriſtians, as well Clergy as People, without diſtinguiſhing Age, or Sex. <hi>John Cochloeus,</hi> writing againſt <hi>Muſculus</hi> a Proteſtant, <hi>Joſſe Clicthou,</hi> upon the Canon of the Maſs,

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:47504:92"/>doubt, was alwayes obſerved in the Weſt, becauſe at the time it ceaſed in the Latin Church, that is to ſay, in the Twelfth Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury at ſooneſt, thoſe who went out and departed from her, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved it very Religiouſly, never celebrating the Euchariſt without Communicants, until the laſt ſeparation of Proteſtants, whoſe practice alſo it is.</p>
                  <p>Having ſpoken of the Communion of aged perſons, we muſt treat of that of young Children, according to the rule which was propoſed. St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> reports the ſtory of a little Chriſtian Girl,

<note place="margin">Id. Ep. 59.</note> 
                     <hi>The Sacrament</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>not enduring to abide in this polluted Mouth and Body, and indeed ſhe vomited what they had forced her to take.</hi> The ſame may be collected from another place in his Works, where he defines, with his Brethren and fellow Biſhops, that nothing hinders the Baptizing of Infants preſently after their Birth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that for the moſt part the participation of the Sacrament followed the reception of Baptiſm; and to ſay the truth, it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that he explains himſelf ſufficiently, not to leave us the leaſt doubt of it. In the Apoſtolical conſtitution,
<note place="margin">Conſt. Apoſt. l. 8. c. 13.</note> Children are count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed amongſt thoſe who ought to Communicate: this cuſtom then is very antient, ſeeing we find it eſtabliſhed in the third Century: but if it is antient, it was alſo of a large extent, this cuſtom ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſince continued in all Chriſtian Climats and Countreys, and is at this time practiſed in all the Churches of the Greeks, the Ruſſians or Moſcovites, the Armenians, and Ethiopians, and we do not find that thoſe Chriſtian Communions have ever laid it aſide; which doth fully prove what we ſaid, That this cuſtom was ſoon ſpread into all parts of the Chriſtian World. But to ſpeak particularly of the Latin Church, we muſt, as near as may be, follow the ſteps of this antient practice: and in the firſt place, I will inſtance in what hath been ſaid by the Jeſuit <hi>Maldonat,</hi> in his Commentaries upon St. <hi>John.
<note place="margin">Maldon. in c. 6. Joan. v. 53.</note> I lay apart</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of St.</hi> Auſtin, <hi>and of</hi> Innocent <hi>the Firſt, which was believed and practiſed in the Church ſix hundred years, That the Sacrament alſo was neceſſary for young Children; at preſent the thing hath been cleared by the Church, and the practice of ſeveral Ages, and by a Decree of the Council of</hi> Trent, <hi>that not only it is not neceſſary for them,
<note place="margin">Ep. ad Syn. Mil. apud Aug. Ep. 93.</note> but that alſo it is not permitted to give it unto them.</hi> And indeed <hi>Innocent</hi> the Firſt ſhews plainly that it was the practice of his time, that is, of

<note place="margin">Serom. l. 1. p. 271.</note> and it may be collected from <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> that it was ſo practiſed at the end of the Second Century.

                     <p>Of the things diſtributed and received.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WHat was diſtributed unto Believers in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating, were the things which had been Bleſſed and Conſecrated, to be made the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Body and Blood of our Lord. I will not now examine the change which Conſecration may thereunto bring, this not being the place to treat of the Doctrine of the holy Fathers, which ſhall appear in the ſecond part of this Treatiſe: it will ſuffice here to enquire if Chriſtians have always participated of both Symboles, and if they have ever been permitted to Communicate under both kinds, as is ſpoken; or under one kind only. As for the Symbole of Bread, it is an undoubted truth that it hath always been given to Believers in all Chriſtian Communions in the whole world; and there hath never been any conteſt on this ſubject, at leaſt in what regards the thing it ſelf, I mean the matter of fact, not to ſpeak of the difference touching the quality of the Bread which ought to be uſed in this Myſtery: The greateſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty then is to know the practice of the Church in the <hi>ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies</hi> of Wine; we are indiſpenſably forced to treat of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion under both kinds, and to lay before the Readers eyes the practice of Chriſtians, with the changes and innovations which have therein happened. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who diſtributed the Bread unto his Apoſtles, gave unto them alſo the Cup, and expreſly commanded them all to drink of it, as S. <hi>Matthew</hi> hath written: S. <hi>Mark</hi> hath ſaid that they all drank of it. The Chriſtians im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately following the Apoſtles practiſed the very ſame; but becauſe it would make a whole Volume, to collect the paſſages of the Ancients to prove the certainty of this matter, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, both Roman Catholicks, as well as Proteſtants, confeſs, That <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> did inſtitute this Sacrament under both kinds, That the Apoſtles taught ſo, and that it was ſo practiſed by the primitive Church for a long time, as I think it may ſuffice to prove this Tradition from age to age by ſome of the clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt paſſages, and to follow it until its aboliſhing at the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and from that time until the Council of <hi>Trent.

                     <hi>That the Body of the Lord be received ſeparately, and alſo the Blood of the Lord;</hi> he ſpeaks neither of neceſſity nor precaution: and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out that, the Canon is clear and intelligible and without any difficulty; it is no eaſiy matter to judge in what manner the Council expreſt it ſelf, it only can be ſaid, that it ſeems to expreſs it ſelf, as <hi>Oderic Vital</hi> ſaith, if it be conſidered in the firſt place, that 'twas in this Council of <hi>Clermont,</hi> the <hi>Croy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſade</hi> was granted for recovering the Holy Land.

<note place="margin">T. 2. Spicil. p. 432.</note> in this Letter which he writes unto one <hi>Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert,</hi> who demanded wherefore the Sacrament was then given ſteept, ſeeing our Saviour gave the Bread and Wine diſtinctly; he approves this new manner of giving the Sacrament, although he owns that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> diſtributed it otherwiſe, and he likes it for the danger of ſhedding, eſpecially upon Feſtival daies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of the great numbers of perſons that then uſe to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate; alſo he touches the inconvenience might happen by reaſon of men that have long and great Beards, repreſenting, that if at their Meals, they wet their Whiskars in the Liquor before they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it in their mouth, it may be feared, they do the ſame in the Conſecrated Wine, if they are admitted unto the Sacramental Cup, which he accounts a great crime, which he chargeth upon the Communicant, and alſo him that celebrates: beſides, to ſtrengthen what he ſaith, of the danger of effuſion upon ſolemn Feſtival daies, when great numbers of Men and Women muſt be communicated of all ſorts, and conditions; he obſerves, that he that officiates, will be ſtill in danger of ſpilling ſomething out of the Sacred Cup, let him take never ſo much care and caution in diſtributing it, becauſe he often runs the hazard of this effuſion, when he is about to drink of it himſelf; which cannot be done, as he tells us, without falling into a great ſin, whereof he muſt be obliged to make great repentance. From all which he concludes, in favour of the ſteeped Sacrament, and praiſeth the wiſdom of thoſe who firſt eſtabliſhed this manner of Communicating with the Bread ſteept in Wine, ſaying, <hi>That pious men had prudently directed, that the little portion of the Body ſhould not be given dry, as our Lord had done, but that it ſhould be diſtributed unto Believers ſteeped in the Blood of our Lord, and that by this means it ſhould happen, that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the precept of our Saviour, we ſhould eat his Fleſh, and drink his Blood, and that he that feared to ſin in ſo great a matter, might a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the danger.</hi> And he gives for a reaſon of this conduct, <hi>That we eat dry, and drink liquid what goes down the throat, after having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it in the mouth, either together, or ſeparately.</hi> And becauſe ſome
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:47504:99"/>conſidering that <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> had given the ſteept morſel unto <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das,</hi> did not approve this manner of diſtributing the Sacrament, he ſaith, there's a great deal of difference betwixt the Euchariſt ſteeped, and the Morſel which our Lord gave the Diſciple that betray'd him, becauſe the actions which have a different occaſion, cannot agree well together: Afterwards taking with many others, the Decree of the Council of <hi>Braga,</hi> of the year 675. againſt the ſteeped Sacrament, for a Decree of Pope <hi>Julius,</hi> he ſaith, this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree is no longer of force with modern perſons, and that the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms of the Church, which ſurpaſſe all others, as well in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, as in authority, hath overcome this ancient Conſtitution, that it ſhould not be thought ſtrange, becauſe the Decrees of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popes are changed for the like, and ſometimes upon ſmaller occaſions.</p>
                  <p>But although this Author of the XII. Century, of whom Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal <hi>Cuſa</hi> cites ſomething in <hi>Caſſander,</hi> in his Liturgies, gives us this form of adminiſtring the Sacrament with ſteept Bread, as eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd in his time in the <hi>Weſt;</hi> it cannot be ſaid, that it was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally received in all Churches without exception. In fine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides what we alledged out of the Micrologue, and of Pope <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal,</hi> who made his Decree in the XII. Century; <hi>Arnold</hi> of <hi>Bonne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val,</hi> contemporary with S. <hi>Bernard,</hi> in his Sermon of the Supper of the Lord, in S. <hi>Cyprian</hi>'s Works, ſheweth us ſufficiently, that in the ſame XII.

Therefore ſuch a cuſtom being reaſonably introduced both by the Church and by the holy Fathers, and that it was a long while obſerved, it ought to paſs for a Law, which is not allowed to be rejected, nor changed by every bodies fancy, without the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Church. Therefore they are to be judged erroneous, that think it to be Sacrilegious or unjuſt to obſerve this cuſtom, or this Law; and thoſe who obſtinately affirm the contrary of what is above ſaid, ought to be baniſhed as Hereticks, and ſeverely puniſhed by the Dioceſans of the places, or their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cials, or by the Inquiſitors of the Heretical evil, in the Kingdoms or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, where by hazard or on purpoſe, they have attempted or preſumed any thing againſt this Decree, according to the lawful Ordinances and Canons which have been ſeaſonably made againſt Hereticks, and their abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors againſt the Catholick Faith.</hi> But notwithſtanding the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of this Decree, <hi>Caſſander</hi> hath left us upon Record in his Treatiſe of the Communion under both kinds formerly cited, <hi>That it is read, that Pope</hi> Martin <hi>the Fifth,

                     <hi>That therefore the Holy Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Church, being ſenſible of this wholſom Authority in the admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Sacraments, although that at the beginning of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the uſe of both kinds was frequent; nevertheleſs, in proceſs of time this cuſtom being changed, it was introduced for wiſe and ſolid reaſons, to approve this cuſtom of communicating under one kind, and hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it to paſs into a Law, which ſhall not be allowed to be alter'd or laid aſide at pleaſure, without the Authority of the ſame Church.</hi> And in the following Chapter, which is the Third of Doctrine, <hi>It declares moreover, That though our Redeemer (as it is ſaid) in his laſt Supper, inſtituted this Sacrament under both kinds, and gave it unto his Apoſtles; Yet it muſt be confeſſed, that</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>intirely, and the true Sacrament; is received under one ſpecies, and that ſo, as to what concerns the benefit, ſuch are not deprived of any grace neceſſary to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who receive but under one kind.</hi> After all which, the Council makes theſe three Canons: <hi>If any one ſhall ſay,
<note place="margin">Can. 1.</note> that by the command of Chriſt, or for neceſſity of Salvation, all Believers in general, and each one in particular, is obliged to receive both kinds of the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Euchariſt, let him be Anathema. If any one ſhall ſay,
<note place="margin">Can. 2.</note> that the holy Catholick Church was not moved by juſt cauſes, and reaſons, to adminiſter the Communion unto the Laity, and Clergy not officiating, under the ſpecies of Bread only, or that ſhe hath therein erred, let him be Anathema. If any body ſhall deny, that whole Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Can. 3.</note> the Fountain and Author of all Graces, is received under the ſole ſpecies of Bread, becauſe as ſome falſely ſuggeſt, he is not received according to Chriſt's own In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution under both kinds, let him be accurſed.</hi> See here exactly whereunto things amounted in the <hi>Weſt.</hi> Whereupon ſome have made theſe Reflections; In the firſt place, that about 300. years before the uſe of the Cup was taken away from the people by publick Authority; the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> had ſeparated themſelves from the Latin Church, to make a Body apart, which Body hath alwaies practiſed the Communion under both kinds: Secondly, that at the time the Council of <hi>Conſtance</hi> made her De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree, there was in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> beſides the <hi>Calixtins,</hi> who only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the uſe of the Cup, agreeing in all other points with the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the <hi>Taborites,</hi> ſo called from the Mountain <hi>Tabor</hi> where they had their Aſſemblies, unto whom ſome joining ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> who, according to the teſtimony of <hi>Dubravius,</hi> had ſheltered themſelves in thoſe parts ever ſince the XII. Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that there were not only of theſe <hi>Waldenſes</hi> at that time in <hi>Bohemia</hi> only, but alſo that there were great numbers of them in <hi>England,</hi> in <hi>Provence,</hi> the Valleys of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> and elſewhere. In the third place, that when the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> in our Fathers daies, renewed and confirmed the Decree of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> touching
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:47504:102"/>the taking away the Cup from the Laity, and Clergy that did not officiate, yet it referred unto the Popes diſpoſing and power, to grant it unto thoſe whom he ſhould think fitting, and upon what conditions he ſhould judge convenient, without inſiſting here up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the liberty our Kings have of Communicating under both kinds. In the fourth place, that ſince the Decree of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> an infinite number of perſons of that ſame Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, earneſtly wiſhed, that the uſe of the Cup which had been taken away, might be reſtored unto the people. Thoſe which be any thing curious, may read what <hi>Caſſander</hi> hath written, a man of the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church, and very intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity; I ſay, in his Conſultation, <hi>Art.</hi> 22. In his Defence of the Book touching the Duty of a Devout Man, <hi>page</hi> 864. and in his Treatiſe of the Communion under both kinds; and the demand which <hi>Catherine de Medicis,</hi> Queen of <hi>France,</hi> cauſed to be made unto the Pope in the behalf of <hi>France, Anno</hi> 1561. as is related at large by <hi>Monſieur de Thou,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Hiſt. Thuan. l. 27.</note> in his Hiſtory. In fine, that the practice of all Chriſtians is contrary to that of the Latins, becauſe they all adminiſter the Sacrament of the Lords Supper under both kinds, to wit, the <hi>Grecians,</hi> the <hi>Melchites</hi> or <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> the <hi>Georgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Circaſſians,</hi> and <hi>Mingrelians,</hi> the <hi>Muſcovites,</hi> and <hi>Ruſſians,</hi> the <hi>Neſtorians,</hi> the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of S. <hi>Thomas</hi> in the <hi>Indies,</hi> before they turned to the Latins, which was but in the laſt Century heither did they renounce their belief or worſhip, to imbrace the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Latin Church, till the year 1599. the <hi>Jacobites,</hi> which are exceeding numerous, the <hi>Cophtites,</hi> or Chriſtians in <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt,</hi> the <hi>Abaſſins</hi> under <hi>Preſter John,</hi> who is one of the greateſt Princes in the World, the <hi>Armenians;</hi> and in fine, the <hi>Maronites,</hi> until that they ſubmitted themſelves unto the Latin Church in <hi>Clement</hi> VIII. his time. It is certain, there is ſome difference in the manner of diſtributing the Sacrament under both kinds a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt theſe Chriſtian Nations; for ſome of them put the Bread and Wine both together in a Spoon, as the <hi>Muſcovites;</hi> others ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the Sacrament ſteeped, as the <hi>Armenians;</hi> if we may cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit ſome perſons; It is ſaid, that the <hi>Greeks</hi> at this time do ſo, heretofore they diſtributed both kinds ſeparately. In effect I ſee, that all agree that the <hi>Greeks</hi> give the Bread ſteept. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Humbert</hi> Cardinal of <hi>Blanoh-Selva,</hi> writing againſt the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies of the <hi>Greeks</hi> in the XI. Century, ſaid, That they put the Bread and Wine together, as we ſaid the <hi>Muſcovites</hi> do, who are of the Religion of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> taking them in a Spoon, which the Laity do at this time by relation of <hi>Goar,</hi> in his Notes upon the <hi>E<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>chology;</hi> but the Clergy receive both kinds ſeparately. As for all the other Chriſtians above mentioned, they Communicate
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:47504:102"/>under both kinds ſeparately, unto whom we may join all the Proteſtant Chriſtians; but ſo it is, that there is not any one Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Communion in the whole World, excepting only the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, but believe that the uſe of both Symbols is neceſſary unto a lawful Communion, whatever difference there may be amongſt them in the manner of adminiſtring of it. Now it is evident by what hath been ſaid, that unto this Communion under both kinds, cannot be oppoſed that, called the Communion of the Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty by the Ancients, becauſe that means nothing elſe, as the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both ſides agree, but to communicate with the people, and not with the Clergy; for inſtance, when a Clergy-man was degraded from his Office for ſome great ſin, he was reduced to the degree of the common people, amongſt whom he did com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate, and not with the Clergy, which is at this time practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed amongſt the <hi>Abyſſins,</hi> and amongſt the Proteſtants; but that makes nothing to the communicating under one kind, becauſe the people participated of both kinds; Nor the <hi>peregrine</hi> Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whereof mention is made, but very ſeldom, in the Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which remain unto us of Antiquity; for all the certain knowledge we have of it, by reaſon of the few places that ſpeak of it, is, that it regarded ſtrangers who came from ſome other parts, unto ſome Church where they were admitted to receive the Sacrament; but after the manner that 'twas there celebrated, under both kinds. If this <hi>peregrine</hi> Communion may not better be underſtood of Clergy-men which travelled from one Church to another without Atteſtations or Certificates, in which caſe they were civilly received by reaſon of their character, but without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them unto the Communion of Divine Myſteries, almoſt as S. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſerved <hi>Ammonius,</hi> and <hi>Iſidorus;</hi> which alſo adminiſtred unto <hi>Theophilus</hi> Bp. of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> a pretext for perſecuting S. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome;</hi> Nor that Believers were ſuffered to carry home unto their Houſes the Bread of the Euchariſt, to take it when they pleas'd: for beſides, that it was an abuſe which indeed was tolerated along time in the Church, but could be no prejudice unto the practice generally received, it may be obſerved, that thoſe very perſons which carried home with them the Bread of the Sacrament, did it not in all likelihood until after they had eaten part of it in the Aſſembly, and participated of the Cup of the Lord. Nor that there was given unto ſick Folks at the point of Death, the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt ſteeped, becauſe it was a thing extraordinary, and that beſide it was ſhewn by this practice, that both Symbols were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be neceſſary, nor that the XI. Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits the Cup only to be given unto thoſe who are ſo weak, that they are not able to ſwallow down the conſecrated Bread, unto
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:47504:103"/>whom Pope <hi>Paſchal</hi> II. joins young Children, becauſe this ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferance is grounded upon invincible neceſſity, as well as that which is practiſed by ſome Proteſtant Churches, towards thoſe who have naturally ſuch an averſion for Wine, that 'tis not in their power to ſurmount; in which caſes, ſhe diſpenſeth with the participation of the Cup, and is content to adminiſter the Bread only.</p>
                  <p>After what hath been hitherto ſpoken of the Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both kinds, I think it will be needleſs to add any more unto this Hiſtory, which if I miſtake not, I have written large enough to ſatisfie the curioſity of thoſe who deſire to be informed of what paſſed in the ancient Church, in the practice of ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a matter, as is that of the Communion of the holy Cup; not but that a great number of other teſtimonies may be alledged for the eſtabliſhment of this Tradition; but when I conſider that if the great number of paſſages doth not prejudice the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which is examined, yet it proves tedious unto the Reader, when too large: I ſhall forbear alledging any more to avoid ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring thoſe who ſhall give themſelves the trouble of reading this Treatiſe; and I forbear the rather, that if they are perſons who have any knowledge of Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, they will know of themſelves without my help, that there be many others in the Works of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> of S. <hi>Ambroſe, Gaudentius,</hi> S. <hi>Jerome,</hi> S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> beſides thoſe related by <hi>Gratian</hi> in his Decree of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt, in the <hi>Roman</hi> Order, in the Books of Images, under the name of <hi>Charlemaine,</hi> in the Writings of <hi>Rabanus</hi> of <hi>Paſchaſe,</hi> of <hi>Oecumenius, Theophylact, Fulbert</hi> of <hi>Chartres, Humbert</hi> of <hi>Blanch-Selva,</hi> of <hi>Lanfranc, Guilmond, Rupert de Duitz, Alger,</hi> S. <hi>Bernard, Odo</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Cambray,</hi> of <hi>Lombard</hi> Maſter of the Sentences, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; as for ſuch as have not applied themſelves to the reading the Holy Fathers, they may ſufficiently inform themſelves of what I have written, how Chriſtians have from time to time governed themſelves in the matter of communicating under both kinds. Therefore I ſhall content my ſelf in touching a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance which I had almoſt forgotten, and which in all likelihood will not be diſpleaſing unto any; it concerns a Chalice of Saint <hi>Remy</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheims;</hi> this Prelate who was ſo famous in our <hi>France,</hi> eſpecially after he had Baptized <hi>Clovis</hi> the firſt of our Kings who imbraced the Chriſtian Religion: this Prelate I ſay, did Conſecrate unto God a Cup to diſtribute the Communion un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the people, upon which he cauſed three Latin Verſes to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graved, which are preſerved unto our daies, although the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice is not in being, the Church of <hi>Rheims</hi> having been conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to melt it, and to pay it for their Ranſom unto the <hi>Normans,</hi>
                     <pb n="149" facs="tcp:47504:103"/>above 700. years ago; and theſe Verſes plainly ſhew, that in S. <hi>Remy</hi>'s time, that is, towards the end of the V. Century, the people did not participate of the Bread of the Sacrament only, but alſo of the Cup of Benediction: <hi>Flodoard</hi> cites them in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Church of <hi>Rheims,</hi> and I'll make no difficulty of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting them in this Hiſtory, in the ſame ſtile in which they were written; <q>

                     </q> Now I ſay to conclude this Chapter, it appears plainly by all that hath been ſaid, that the Chriſtian Church univerſally practiſed the Communion under both kinds ſeparately, the ſpace of 1000. years; that ſince that time, they began in ſome places in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Church, to adminiſter the Sacrament mixt, or ſteeped; from the Euchariſt ſteeped, they came in proceſs of time to diſtribute the conſecrated Bread only, not in all places, but in ſome Churches, until that the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> in the Year 1415. commanded by a publick Decree, the Communion to be given under one kind only, which yet was not ſo generally obeyed, but that we have produced ſince that time, examples and inſtances of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary practice. But in fine, the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> made its laſt Eſſay in the manner as hath been above declared; as for all the other Chriſtian Churches which hold no commerce with the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, they adminiſter the Sacrament under both Symbols, although it be with ſome little difference.</p>

                  <p>BUT becauſe it is not ſufficient to know the things which were diſtributed unto Communicants, if we do not at the ſame time know the manner they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by Believers; I think fit to imploy this Chapter in the inquiry of this Cuſtom and Practice. When <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> celebrated and inſtituted his firſt Sacrament, he ſaid unto his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, <hi>Take;</hi> the <hi>Greek</hi> word uſed by him in this place imports, <hi>to take with the hand,</hi> or <hi>receive with the hand what is given;</hi> accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly the ancient Chriſtians which ſucceeded the Age of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles did in the very ſame manner; and it is certain, that all the Communicants generally received with the hand in the Church, the Sacrament of the Euchariſt; ſo <hi>Tertulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> teacheth us in his Treatiſe of Idolatry, where ſhewing, that it is not lawful for a Chriſtian Workman to make Idols, that is to ſay, Images of falſe Gods, he expreſſeth his anger againſt any amongſt the Chriſtians,

                     <hi>Norbert preaching, the Men and Women being pricked at the heart, brought the Body of our Lord which, for ten Years and upwards, they had hid in Cheſts and corners; from which things, ſaith</hi> Molanus, Pontac <hi>in his Chronology doth conclude, That Chriſtians at that time, did receive the Body of Chriſt with their hand.</hi> And in truth, <hi>Pontac,</hi> who was one of the moſt Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men of his time, had reaſon ſo to judge, being neceſſarily inferr'd from the words of the Continuator of <hi>Sigebert.</hi> Thoſe poor people, of whom he ſpeaks, were ſeduced by a certain Heretick called <hi>Tanchelin,</hi> or as 'tis in the Edition I have, <hi>Tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,</hi> who had perſwaded the Inhabitants of <hi>Antwerp,</hi> which was a very populous City, That the participation of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> was not neceſſary unto Salvation; therefore they had hid in certain places, the Body of our Lord, until ſuch time as they were diſabuſed by <hi>Norbert,</hi> unto whom both Men and Women after ten years time, and more, brought what each had hid: but in the main it appears, that in the Twelfth Century, Communicants received the Sacrament in their hand; for otherwiſe, thoſe we ſpeak of, could not have done what hath been mentioned, and I know not whether unto this purpoſe may not be referred the fifth Canon of the Council of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> Aſſembled in the Year of our Lord 1228. which ordains,

<pb n="159" facs="tcp:47504:108"/>ever practiſed in the Weſt, ever ſince Chriſtianity had been firſt eſtabliſhed; becauſe that before the Latin Church had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed this cuſtom, the <hi>Albigenſes,</hi> and <hi>Waldenſes,</hi> had ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves from its Communion, and carefully practiſed it amongſt them, until the time the Proteſtants ſeparated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who continue to practiſe it at this time.

                  <p>But if the Sacrament was ſent unto the abſent, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſent unto ſick Folks; It is true, great care muſt be taken in diſtinguiſhing betwixt ſick Believers, and Penitents: by ſick Believers is underſtood Chriſtians Baptized, who had preſerved the purity of their Baptiſm, or at leaſt who had not commited any of thoſe ſins which reduced thoſe which were convict, into a ſtate of Penance: and by Penitents, I mean ſuch as after their Baptiſm were faln into ſome great Sin, which made them liable unto the orders of the hard and painful Penance, which was obſerved in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity. As for the former, I find not, in what remains unto us of the three firſt Ages of the Chriſtian Religion, any proof, that the Euchariſt was given them at the hour of Death, this cuſtom not appearing till afterwards; what <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> ſaid, not properly regarding the Sick, but thoſe that were abſent, as is confeſſed by the learned Mr.

<note place="margin">Concil.

The Councils are full of Canons which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the time and manner of abſolving Penitents, which was inſeparable from receiving of the Sacrament, which was gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven them as the laſt <hi>Viaticum,</hi> to aſſure them that they were reconciled unto God in their being ſo with the Church, which was accuſtomed to ſeal this reconciliation and peace in permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them to participate of this Divine Myſtery. But if I am demanded, Whether this practice of adminiſtring the Sacrament unto bed-rid Penitents, and, after the third Century, unto o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſick Folks at the time of death, doth not preſuppoſe that the Euchariſt was kept to the end it might be apply'd in theſe haſty neceſſities? to ſpeak ſincerely, I do not ſee there was any neceſſary conſequence of one of theſe things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the other; but that alſo I find no directions thereupon in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, which makes me believe, they contented themſelves then, in preparing, I mean in Bleſſing and Conſecrating the Bread and Wine to make them the Body and Blood of the Lord, at ſuch time as there was occaſion to communicate any Bed-rid dying perſons. To al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, for refutation of the keeping the Sacrament, what is written in the XI.

                     <p>Sundry Cuſtoms and Practices touching the Sacrament.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AMONGST ſeveral cuſtoms obſerved by the antient Church touching the Euchariſt, I find in the firſt place, that they made Plaiſters of it; for St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> makes mention of a Child which being born blind, by reaſon that the Eye-lids were cloſed, and thereby deprived of ſight, although the Eyes were full within; a Phyſician adviſing to open the Eye-lids with an Iron inſtrument,
<note place="margin">Aug. Oper. Imperf. contr. Julian. l. 3. c. 164.</note> 
                     <hi>His pious Mother</hi> (ſaith he,) <hi>would not ſuffer it; but what the Phyſician would have done with his Lancet, ſhe affected with a Plaiſter made of the Sacrament; the Child being then five years old or upwards, ſaid that he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred it very well.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, the antient Chriſtians buried the Sacrament with their Dead. In the life of S. <hi>Baſil</hi> which is commonly attributed unto <hi>Amphilochius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Iconia,</hi> his Contemporary, for they both flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed towards the end of the Fourth Century; there is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proof of this cuſtom; the truth is, I would not abſolutely ingage that <hi>Amphilochius</hi> was Author of it: on the contrary, I take it to be forged and falſe,
<note place="margin">De Script. in an. 380.</note> and I find Cardinal <hi>Bellarmain</hi> of the ſame Opinion; but it is not only now it bears the name of <hi>Amphilochius,</hi> it was attributed unto him a long while ſince, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though 'tis not eaſy preciſely to know the time that he was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be the Author of it. <hi>Aeneas,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi>

<pb n="170" facs="tcp:47504:114"/>Century, ſeeing that a <hi>Dioceſan</hi> Synod of <hi>Auxerr,</hi> did prohibit it in the year 578. <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, in his Dialogues, relates the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of a young Youth that was a Frier, and that being gone out of the Monaſtry to ſee his Parents, without the Benediction, dyed the ſame day that he came home, and after he had been buried, next day the Body was found caſt out of the Grave; and having again buried it, the ſame accident hapned again: then the Friers ſpeedily went unto S. <hi>Bennet,</hi> and prayed him with tears to ſhew favour unto the deceaſed Party.

                     <hi>found under his head and about his Breaſt, certain little bits of Bread of a round form, which were commonly called Olations, or Wafers, which the Biſhop laid again with much veneration near the holy Body.

                  <p>In the third place, there were Churches where they burnt all that reſted of the Communion, it was ſo practiſed in the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as <hi>Heſychius</hi> one of its Prieſts doth teſtifie, in his Commentaries upon <hi>Leviticus;</hi>

<pb n="171" facs="tcp:47504:114"/>Liberty of the Churches, either to keep theſe remainders, or to eat them; and becauſe if the loaf of the Communion had been too big for the number of Communicants of each Church, the remainder, by reaſon of the too great quantity, might have oppreſt the ſtomach of thoſe that eat it; the Fathers of the Council, to prevent this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, commanded to offer, <hi>Midling Oblations,
<note place="margin">Concil.

               <p>THOSE which travel into ſtrange Countries, if they are any thing curious, fail not taking notice of the Things which they judg moſt conſiderable and worthy their Obſervation: It is true, all are not alike diſpoſed, ſome regard only their own private Satisfaction, and look no farther; but there be others, which undertaking theſe long and painful Voyages, make as it were a kind of Journal, wherein they exactly ſet down all things which deſerve to be known; and being return'd home, they digeſt and communicate them unto others; who without ſtirring out of their Cloſet, or running any Danger, ſee what is most curious and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable in all Countries and Parts of the World. And certainly all Men are oblig'd unto thoſe Perſons, which are ſo good and charitable, as to expoſe themſelves unto a thouſand Dangers and Inconveniences to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and inſtruct us. This is in ſome ſort the caſe of thoſe, which un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to travel into the Countries of Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, which is of a vaſt extent, having no other Limits than thoſe of the whole <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe, as well as the Kingdom of Jeſus Chriſt (unto whom the heavenly Father
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:47504:116"/>hath given all Nations for his Heritage, and the Earth for his Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;) there are in this Country a multitude of different Climates, very many conſiderable Rarities, worthy the Curioſity of Chriſtians: but all which ingage in theſe Voyages, are not of a humour to take pains for the Publick; they keep themſelves cloſe and private, and aiming only at their own particular Satisfaction, they trouble themſelves not much for others; ſo that were there only ſuch Perſons which lanched forth to viſit this large Empire, we ſhould neither be more learned, nor better inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But the Providence of God, which is always vigilant for the good of Mankind, puts it into the Heart of ſeveral to undertake this great Voyage, with a Reſolution and Deſign of communicating, what they have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, unto the Publick, that it may ſerve for the Inſtruction and Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Chriſtians. It's true ſome indeed diſcharge their Duty better than others, thereafter as God is pleaſed to diſtribute his Gifts and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; but every one ſhould and ought with all diligence and fidelity to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute his Endeavours, and improve the Talent which our Lord hath committed unto his truſt. This is what I have endeavoured to do hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, and which I intend to do for the time to come, if it be not with all the Delight and Ornament the Reader could wiſh, at leaſt it ſhall be with all the Sincerity which can be expected from one, who believes to have well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow'd his Labour and Pains, if his Endeavours would create in the Minds of Chriſtians, divided by various Opinions in Religion, more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Inclinations of Love and Charity, and greater Deſires unto Peace and Concord. We have already ſeen all that relates unto the outward Form of the Celebration of the Sacrament, with the Alterations thereunto hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in ſucceſſion of time: now we muſt endeavour to diſcover what hath been believed of this Myſtery in this large and ſpacious Country; but to do it the more orderly, and to ſhew with more eaſe and clearneſs the Hiſtory of the Innovations which have happened as well in the Expreſſions, as in the Doctrine, we will extend our Proofs; as to the Expreſſions, but unto the ſeventh and eighth Centuries, at which time they ſuffer'd ſome At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; and as to the Doctrine, unto the ninth, ſuppoſing it received ſome Alteration in the beginning of that Age.</p>

                     <p>The Reflections made by the Fathers upon the Words of the Inſtitution of the Sacrament.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THE holy Fathers had ſo great a Love for Jeſus Chriſt, and Veneration for all his Inſtitutions, that they took a ſingular pleaſure in meditating upon this great Myſtery, and in making di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Reflections upon this divine Inſtitution. Our Lord ſaid of the Bread which he had taken, which he bleſſed, and which he broke, <hi>That it was his Body;</hi> and of the Wine, <hi>that it was his Blood.</hi> The antient Doctors of the Church conſidering this Expreſſion of the Son of God, have declared with a common Conſent, and as it were united Suffrages, that Jeſus Chriſt called the Bread and Wine, his Body and his Blood: <q>Our Lord, ſaid St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Iren. l. 5. c. 2. Tatian. tom. 7. Bibl. Patr.</note> has aſſured that the Bread was his Body.</q> 
                     <hi>Tatian</hi> in his Harmony upon the Evangeliſts ſaith: <q>That he teſtified that the Bread, and the Cup of Wine, were his Body and Blood.</q> 
                     <hi>Tertullian,</hi>

                     <q>That he called his Body, the Bread which was made of the collection of ſeveral Grains.</q> The Author of the Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon the Evangeliſts, which go in the Name of <hi>Theophilus</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> though 'tis not certain whether they be his, for all they are attributed unto him in the Library of the Fathers, this Author, I ſay, has expreſſed his thoughts almoſt as St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> had done, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: <q>That Jeſus Chriſt called his Body,
<note place="margin">Theophil.

Euſebius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ceſarea</hi> in <hi>Paleſtin,</hi> had no other meaning I think, when he ſaid:

                     </q> Nor the Poet <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vencus,</hi> when he declares:

<note place="margin">Auguſt. apud Fulgen. de Baptiſ. Aeth. cap. vet. Cyril. l. 12. in Joar. 20.26, 27.</note> ſaith expreſly: <hi>That the Bread is the Body of Chriſt, and the Cup is the Blood of Chriſt.</hi> St. <hi>Cyrill</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> was doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs of the ſame mind, for in his Commentary upon St. <hi>John</hi> he makes Chriſt ſay, <hi>Of the Bread which he broke and diſtributed, this is my Body which is given for you in Remiſſion of Sins.</hi> We may deſcend lower, and carry further the Proof of this firſt Reflection, were we not prevented by the Rule which we preſcribed, and of the Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution taken, of avoiding, as much as poſſible may be, the repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſame Teſtimonies. It ſhall then ſuffice to inform the Reader, that 'tis a certain Truth owned by all Men, both Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants and Roman Catholicks, that when there is a Diſpute of two Subjects of a different Nature, it cannot properly be ſaid that the one is the other; when therefore theſe ſorts of Propoſitions meet in Diſcours, of neceſſity recours muſt be had unto the Figure, or Metaphor.</p>
                  <p>What the Fathers have depoſed is conſiderable; yet I do not think it ſufficient, nor that it is all which they have to ſay unto us. If we examine anew theſe faithful Witneſſes, I doubt not but they will ſpeak again, and that they will inform us of other Truths be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides them above-mentioned; and that they will not leave us igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant how they underſtood the Words of the Inſtitution of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt Sacrament. Thoſe which have diligently applied themſelves to the reading of Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, have doubtleſs found by Experience, that ſometimes one muſt travel very far, and ſearch many large Volumes, before one finds what he looks for; and I look upon theſe dry and barren Places to be like Wilderneſſes and ſad unpleaſant Deſerts, which Travellers are ſometimes forc'd to
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:47504:117"/>paſs over with much difficulty and trouble: but they have alſo ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that ſometimes are found without difficulty, in the Works of the Ancient Fathers, places ſo rich and abundant, that I uſe to liken them unto thoſe fat and fertile Soils, which always anſwer the Husbandman's expectation, and which with Intereſt reſtore the pains he with ſome little coſt beſtowed upon them. We may in the number of theſe latter ſort place thoſe Paſſages, where they have pleaſed themſelves in meditating of the Myſtery of the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: for not content to have told us that its divine Author called the Bread and Wine, his Body and Blood, I find them ready to tell us, <hi>that they were his Body broken, and his Blood poured out;</hi> and that as for them, they always conſidered him at that moment, not as ſitting upon his Throne in Heaven, but as hanging upon the Croſs on Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> expiating the Sins of Mankind, and for the Redemption of the World. This was in all likelihood what St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> intended, when he ſaid,
<note place="margin">Cypr. ep. 63.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Sacrifice which we offer is the Death of our Lord.</hi> And what St. <hi>Gregory</hi> of <hi>Nyſs,</hi> when he teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies, <hi>That the Body of the Sacrifice is not fit to be eat, if it be animated,</hi>

<note place="margin">Apud Hieron. Ep. ad Hedib. q. 2.</note> 
                     <q>
                        <hi>I ſay unto you I will no more drink of the Fruit of the Vine, until I drink it new with you in my Fathers Kingdom;</hi> from this place, ſaith St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> ſome dream of the Fable of a 1000 years, during which they argue Jeſus Chriſt ſhall reign corporally, and that he will drink Wine, whereof he drank not from that time until the end of the World.</q> What St. <hi>Jerome</hi> diſlikes in them, is the reign of a 1000 years, during which they imagined that Chriſt ſhould drink Wine upon Earth; whereof he had not taſted any from the moment which he drank in the celebration of the Sacrament, and whereof he was not to drink until this pretended Reign of a 1000 years.</p>
                  <p>The firſt thing to be conſidered in a Diſcourſe is the Scope and Deſign of him that ſpeaks, becauſe 'tis the Mind that ſets the Tongue a going, and that 'tis with regard to his Intention, when he hath diſcourſed of a Matter, the Expreſſions made uſe of muſt be conſidered for repreſenting his Thoughts; without this we muſt needs ſtray, or at leaſt fall into one of theſe Inconveniencies, either not to comprehend the Senſe of what is read, or to impute unto him that ſpeaks things which are ſtrange, or even ſometimes unjuſt and unreaſonable: For Example, Jeſus Chriſt commands us in the Goſpel to imitate the Wiſdom of the unjuſt Steward which had wickedly waſted the Goods committed by his Lord unto his Truſt; this Precept, to conſider it barely and litterally, is very wide of the Mark which our Saviour intends, contains a wicked Practice, and quite different from that which he teacheth us in his Goſpel, which being pure and holy, infinitely ſurpaſſeth what is beſt and moſt commendable in the Heathen Morals: But if we conſider his Scope
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:47504:119"/>and Intention, there is nothing in this Precept which is not worthy the School of Chriſt. What he requires of us is not to imitate the ill-dealing of this unjuſt Steward which waſted his Maſter's Goods; he only would have us imitate his Wiſdom in making Friends, when he ſaw his Stewardſhip was like to be taken from him; that is to ſay, that we alſo ſhould make good uſe of thoſe Goods which he is pleaſed to beſtow on us, and whereof he makes us Stewards; that we ſhould employ them to the relief of the Poor, that by means of our Alms-deeds, and Charity, we ſhould make our ſelves Friends which may contribute unto the ſaving our Souls, by the Prayers which they make unto God for us. Nothing can be more reaſonable than this Rule which St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> lays down;
<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. Hom. in haec verba Pater ſi fieri poteſt. t. 5. p. 125, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>We muſt not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>look only upon the Terms, but the Scope of him that ſpeaks, the cauſe and occaſion of his Diſcourſe, and comparing all together, find out the ſenſe and meaning of what is therein contained.</hi> Nevertheleſs, it muſt be noted, this Rule hath its particular uſe when the Expreſſions are doubtful and difficult, and when by ſtaying at the Terms, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the rigour of the Letter, a convenient Senſe cannot be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto what is ſaid or heard; except in ſuch a caſe, nothing hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders but looking unto the ſcope of him that ſpeaks, ſtreſs may be laid on his Words, and much light taken from his Expreſſions. Thus have the Holy Fathers proceeded in examining the Words uſed by our Saviour, in inſtituting the Sacrament, becauſe all they have told us hitherto, are only ſo many Reflections which they have made upon the Words and Expreſſions of this Merciful Saviour; but becauſe they were verily perſuaded that Jeſus Chriſt, which is Wiſdom it ſelf, had an end in inſtituting this Divine Myſtery, they would know the end and deſign which he propoſed in leaving this precious earneſt of his Love unto his Church; <hi>Do this,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>in remembrance of me; for as often as ye eat this Bread, and drink of this Cup,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, you ſhew the Lord's Death till he come.</hi> From whence they concluded, that the Intention of Jeſus Chriſt in inſtituting the Sacrament, and that of the Church in celebrating it by his Command, was by this means to preſerve amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans the remembrance of his Death and Sufferings; but becauſe his Death doth ſuppoſe his Incarnation and Birth, and that moreover, his bleſſed Reſurrection and Exaltation into Glory enſued thereup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, I find they have included in this Commemoration commanded us by Chriſt, the conſideration of his Incarnation, bitter Death, of his Reſurrection, and of his Aſcenſion into Heaven. According to which ſome of them join unto the conſideration of his Death, that of his Incarnation; as St. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> which ſaith;
<note place="margin">Juſt. Martyr contra Tryph. p. 296.</note> 
                     <q>That the Lord commanded us to make the Bread of the Euchariſt, in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance that he made himſelf Man for thoſe which believe in him,
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:47504:120"/>and for whom he made himſelf Mortal; and the Cup in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of his Blood.</q> But ſometimes alſo, conſidering the Death of Chriſt as the end of his Conception, and of his Birth, becauſe he took not our Nature, and was born of a Virgin but to die, they are content to conſider the Sacrament as a Memorial of his Death only:
<note place="margin">Id. ibid. p. 259.</note> In this regard the ſame St. <hi>Juſtin</hi> ſaid; <q>That Jeſus Chriſt commanded us to make the Bread of the Sacrament in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of the Death which he ſuffered for the Souls of thoſe which have been cleanſed from all Malice.</q> This was alſo the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Tatian</hi> his Diſciple,

<note place="margin">In Cap. 11.1 ad Cor.</note> attributed unto St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> 
                     <q>That Jeſus Chriſt hath left us the laſt Commemoration, or the laſt Remembrance, as if one taking a Voyage into a far Country, would leave a Token with his Friend, to the end that when-ever he look'd on it, he ſhould be mindful of his Love and Kindneſs, which he cannot do without ſhedding Tears if he perfectly loved him; and that he
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:47504:120"/>gave us this Sacrament, to the end that by this means we ſhould always remember the Death which he ſuffered for us.</q> 
                     <hi>Sedulius</hi> hath only tranſcribed this Teſtimony in his Commentaries upon the ſame Epiſtle, and upon the ſame Chapter. <hi>Primatius,</hi> an <hi>African</hi> Biſhop, declares in the VIth Century, that it was his Judgment, and he explained himſelf almoſt as the other two had done; and <hi>Chriſtian Druthmer</hi> will ſay the ſame in the IXth Century: as for the Author of the Apoſtolical Conſtitutions,
<note place="margin">Conſtit.

                  <p>I never think of theſe Words of the Inſtitution of the Sacrament, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> but I deplore with grief and ſorrow of Heart, the State of Chriſtians, which have made the Sacrament, which our Saviour inſtituted, to be the Bond of their Love and Union, the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their Hatred, and the ſorrowful matter of their ſad Diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and as I ſhould be over-joy'd to contribute any thing to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abuſe thoſe which are in Errour, by giving the Words the Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation which they ought to have, I thought one of the beſt means to effect it, was diligently to ſearch in what ſenſe the Holy Fathers have taken them, and in what manner they underſtood them, for I make no queſtion, but a belief agreed upon by Chriſtians at all times, and univerſally received at all times in all the Climates of
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:47504:121"/>the Chriſtian World, is Catholick, Orthodox, and by conſequence worthy to be retained in the Church, as an Apoſtolical Truth. Therefore, I have applied my ſelf unto this Inquiry, to endeavour to find in their Works their true and real Thoughts; and becauſe, for the moſt part in their Homilies, and popular Exhortations, they are tranſported with the fervour of Zeal, and the motions of Piety, which often made them uſe Hyperbolical Expreſſions, fit for the Pulpit, and ſuitable unto Orators, which ſhould be patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and feeling, I have not ſtopt at theſe ſorts of Works, I have chiefly examined Commentaries, and Expoſitions, where for the moſt part they ſpeak Dogmatically, and in cold Blood, and the true and genuine Thoughts of thoſe which write or expound may be ſeen. And but that I mean exactly to keep within the Bounds preſcribed at the beginning of this ſecond Part, I might continue my Inquiry unto the XIIth Century, which would give us the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonies of <hi>Zonaras</hi> a Greek Canoniſt, and of <hi>Rupert de Duitz,</hi> as the IXth doth thoſe of <hi>Raban,</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian Druthmar,</hi> and of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram.</hi> Laying then aſide theſe five Teſtimonies, not to infringe the Law I willingly impoſed on my ſelf, I'le begin vvith <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi>

                     <q>The Lord, ſaith he, in diſtributing the Myſteries, did call the Bread, his Body, and the Wine, his Blood.</q> We may alſo ſay the ſame thing of the counterfeit <hi>Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> which ſaith, <q>That the Lord did declare at his Table, that the conſecrated Bread was his ſacred Body.</q> Of <hi>Facundus,</hi> which ſaith, <q>The Lord himſelf called the Bread which he had bleſſed, and the Cup which he gave his Diſciples, his Body and his Blood.</q> And in fine of <hi>Maxentius</hi> a Religious Perſon, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Prieſt of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> in whoſe Dialogues we read, <q>That the Bread whereof the Univerſal Church doth participate,
<note place="margin">Maxent. cont. Neſt. dial. 2.</note> in remembrance of the Death of our Lord, is his Body.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this is not yet all they have to ſay unto us, there is found in their excellent Works ſeveral other things, which lead us as it were by the hand unto the Knowledg of what we ſearch for. In the firſt place they declare our Bodies are nouriſhed with what we receive at the Lord's Table; as <hi>Juſtin</hi> Martyr, who ſpeaks of the
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:47504:124"/>Euchariſt,

Ibid.</note> as <hi>of a Food wherewith our Fleſh and Blood are nouriſhed by Tranſmutation.</hi> St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> doth depoſe, <hi>that our Fleſh is fed with it, that our Blood, our Body and Fleſh are nouriſhed, increaſed, and do ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt by it.</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, <hi>that it is Bread which fills the Belly.</hi> St. <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Sevill, that the Subſtance of this viſible Bread doth nouriſh the outward Man, and ſatisfies it.</hi> Or as <hi>Ratran,</hi> who hath transferr'd to us his Words, (not any more to be found in <hi>Iſidore</hi>'s Works now printed) <hi>that all that is outwardly received in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Body and Blood of our Lord, is fit to feed the Body.</hi> The Fathers of the ſixteenth Council of <hi>Toledo,</hi> in the Year 693,
<note place="margin">Conc. Tolet. 16. c. 6.</note> ſpeak of the Remainders of the Sacrament, as of a thing, that a quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it may incommode the Stomach. That was alſo the Belief of <hi>Raban</hi> Arch biſhop of <hi>Mayence,</hi> in the ninth Century; and of the <hi>Taborites</hi> in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> in the fifteenth, as ſhall be demonſtrated in time and place convenient.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there are ſome of them that poſitively affirm, that what is diſtributed at the holy Table, is Bread, the Matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, after we have taken and eat it, doth paſs by the common way of our ordinary Food. <hi>Origen</hi> teacheth ſo in plain terms, when expounding theſe Words of the 15th Chap. of St. <hi>Mathew,
<note place="margin">Origen. in Math. 15.</note> That it is not what entreth into the Mouth defileth the Man,</hi> he ſaith, <q>If what enters in the Mouth, goes into the Belly, and is caſt into the Draft; the Meat which is ſanctified by the Word of God and Prayer, goeth alſo into the Belly, according to the groſs part of it, and afterwards into the Draft; but by reaſon of Prayer made over it, it is profitable according to the proportion of Faith, and is the cauſe that the Underſtanding is enlightned and attentive unto what is profitable; and 'tis not the Subſtance of Bread, but the Word pronounced upon it, which is profitable unto him that eateth it not in a way unworthy of the Lord.</q> This Doctrine was alſo taught in the ninth Century by <hi>Raban</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Mayence,</hi> and by <hi>Heribold</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Auxerre,</hi> and I think I lately hinted that <hi>Amalarius Fortunatus,</hi> who liv'd in the ſame Century, was of this Judgment, which ſhall be exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, when we come to inquire into the Belief of the ninth Century. Father <hi>Cellot,</hi> the Jeſuit, attributes the ſame Doctrine un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Greeks.
<note place="margin">Append. Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel. op. 7. p. 564</note> It is true this Doctrine was not the Opinion of all the antient Fathers of the Church; therefore I ſaid at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this Obſervation, that there were ſome of them that did believe ſo: in effect, St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſaith:

                     <q>That the Bread of the Sacrament doth not go into the Belly, and is not caſt out into the Draft; but that it is diſperſt throughout the Subſtance of the Communicant for the good of his Body and Soul.</q> The Author of the Homily of the Euchariſt for the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication,
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:47504:125"/>in St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Works ſaith almoſt the ſame with St. <hi>Cyril:</hi>

                     <q>Take no heed that it is Bread, think not that it is Wine, for they are not caſt out as other Meat, God forbid you ſhould once think ſo; for as when Wax is caſt into the Fire, nothing of its Subſtance doth remain, or there remains no ſuperfluity, or it leaves not behind it neither ſoot nor cinders; in like manner here, imagine that the Myſteries are conſumed with the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the Body.</q> We may add <hi>John Damaſcen</hi> unto theſe two Authors,
<note place="margin">Damaſc. l. 4. Orthodox. fid. cap. 14.</note> who ſpeaks thus: <q>The Shew-bread did repreſent this Bread, and it is this pure Oblation, and without Blood, which the Lord fore-told by the Prophet, which ſhould be offer'd unto him from the Eaſt unto the Weſt, to wit, the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which ſhould paſs into the Subſtance of our Soul and Body, without being conſumed, without being corrupted, or paſſing into the Draft; O God forbid! but paſſing into our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for our Preſervation.</q> Theſe three Teſtimonies, as every one doth ſee, differ from <hi>Origen,</hi> which indeed was alſo the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Raban, Heribold</hi> and <hi>Amalarius;</hi> but if they were not of the Opinion of <hi>Origen,</hi> they were of that of St. <hi>Juſtin</hi> Martyr, <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naeus,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Iſidore</hi> of <hi>Sevil,</hi> of the ſixteenth Council of <hi>To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledo, Ratran,</hi> and others: I mean, that if they believed not with <hi>Origen,</hi> that the Bread of the Euchariſt, as to its material Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, was ſubject unto the ſhameful neceſſity of other common Food, they believed with the others, that it turned it ſelf into our Subſtance, that our Bodies were nouriſhed by it, and that they were increaſed and ſtrengthned by it; and ſo their Difference with <hi>Origen</hi> was only in the Circumſtance, whether or no the holy. Bread went unto the Place of Excrements, <hi>Origen</hi> holding the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmative, the others the Negative: but as to the Ground of the Doctrine, I find them all agreed, and that all of them teach, that what we receive at the Lord's Table, <hi>is the Subſtance of Bread;</hi> which ſome ſubject to the ſame fate of our common Food, that goes into the Belly, and from thence into the Draft; others think this Bread doth paſs into our Subſtance, and if it feed our Souls by the virtue wherewith God accompanies it after Conſecration and lawful Uſe of the Sacrament, it alſo nouriſheth and increaſeth the Body by its proper Nature, without turning into Excrements. And the latter, as I conceive, are inclin'd unto this Opinion the rather, becauſe receiving but very little Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, they made no difficulty to believe that it all turns into our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, the holy Fathers teſtify that this Sacrament is conſumed:
<note place="margin">Aug. de Trin. lib. 3. c. 10.</note> 
                     <hi>The Bread,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin, which is made for that purpoſe, is conſumed in taking the Sacrament:</hi> And again, in the ſame
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:47504:125"/>Chapter: <hi>What is put upon the Table is conſumed, the holy Colebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion being ended.</hi> Commonly there was no more alledged but this Paſſage of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to prove that the antient Chriſtians believed, that what was received at the Sacrament, was of ſuch a nature as to be in effect conſumed. Wherefore I hope the Reader will not be diſpleas'd if I lead him farther, and make it appear, this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Speech was us'd in the Church a long time after St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Death. Theſe Conſiderations we make upon the Doctrine of the holy Fathers, are of ſuch importance, that we endeavour to find out in all Ages of the Chriſtian Church what Foot-ſteps they have left us of it in their Writings. <hi>Hugh Maynard</hi> in his Notes upon the Books of Sacraments of <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, alledgeth, and wholly tranſcribes a Pontifical Manuſcript, which is kept in the Church of <hi>Rouen,</hi> and is, as far as I can gueſs, near to the eighth Century, and probably of later times; in this Pontifical the whole Ceremony of holy Thurſday is repreſented, and amongſt many other Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, this is to be read: <q>When the Biſhop waſheth his Hands,
<note place="margin">In Not. Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nar. in Sacram. Greg. p. 84.</note> and the Deacons go unto the Altar to uncover the holy Things, and that the Biſhop comes to the Altar, ſeparates the Oblations to break them, that he takes ſome of the whole ones to keep un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til next day, the Day of Preparation, and that they communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated without the Blood of the Lord, becauſe the Blood was wholly conſumed the ſame Day.</q> It may be eaſily ſeen that the Blood mentioned by the Pontifical, is not the proper Blood of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; for all Chriſtians unanimouſly confeſs, that the real Blood of our Lord, which was ſhed upon the Croſs for the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind, is ſhed no more, and is not in a ſtate of being conſumed in the Celebration of the Sacrament; then, ſaith the Proteſtant, he muſt needs ſpeak of a Typical and Figurative Blood, I mean of the Myſtical and Sanctified Wine, which Believers drink at the holy Table, and which is ſubject unto the fate of being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed: No other Explication can be given unto the Words of the Pontifical above-mentioned, which doth not ill ſuit with thoſe of St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> and I promiſe my ſelf that the tenth Century (however dark and ignorant it be repreſented by Hiſtorians) will furniſh us with another Witneſs, an Abbot of a famous Monaſtery, which will ſpeak of the other Symbol, what the Pontifical hath ſaid of the Symbol of Wine.</p>
                  <p>In the fourth Place; They avow that the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is an inanimate Subject, as <hi>Theophilus</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Ale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xandria,</hi> for refuting the Opinion of <hi>Origen,</hi> who denied that the holy Ghoſt exerciſed any Operation upon Things that have no Soul; he ſpeaks thus: <q>In affirming this, he doth not conſider,
<note place="margin">Theop. Alex. Paſch. 1. Bibl. Pat. t. 3. p. 87.</note> that in Baptiſm the Myſtical Waters are conſecrated by the holy
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:47504:126"/>Ghoſt, which deſcends, and that the Bread of the Lord, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Body of the Lord is ſhewn forth, and which we break for our Sanctification; and the holy Cup, which with the Bread is ſet upon the Table of the Church, and which are things inanimate, are ſanctified by Prayers, and by the coming of the holy Ghoſt.</q> St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> was not far from this Belief, when comparing the Bread after Conſecration with the Body it ſelf of our Saviour, he ſaid,
<note place="margin">Epiphan. in Anchor.</note> 
                     <q>That the one is round as to its Form, and inſenſible as to its Power; but the other hath the Features and Lineaments of a Body, and is all Life, Motion, and Action.</q> To thus much alſo amounts their Belief, that the Change in the Sacrament concerned not the Nature of the Bread and Wine to change them into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, but only to add unto them the Grace which they had not before: that is to ſay, a quickning and ſanctifying virtue in the right uſe of the Sacrament.
<note place="margin">Theod. dial. 1.</note> 
                     <q>Jeſus Chriſt, ſaith <hi>Theodoret,</hi> hath honoured the viſible Symbols with the Name of his Body and Blood, not in changing their Nature, but in adding the Grace.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the fifth place; Theſe ſame Fathers affirm, that the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine remain after Conſecration: it is the Judgment ment of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. ep. ad Caeſar.</note> 
                     <q>The Bread of the Sacrament, ſaith he, is called Bread before it is ſanctified; but Divine Grace having ſanctified it by the Miniſtry of the Prieſt, it is no longer called Bread, but it is judged worthy to be called the Body of Chriſt, although the Nature of Bread remains.</q> Monſr. <hi>de Marca</hi> in his French Treatiſe of the Euchariſt,
<note place="margin">Pag. 12, 13. of the laſt Edit. pag. 9.</note> doth agree, That until St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,</hi> the Fathers believed that the Bread did not change its Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture after Conſecration: Moreover, he confeſſeth for truth the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> unto <hi>Caeſarius.</hi> As alſo the Abbot <hi>Faggot</hi> doth in his Letter unto Monſr. <hi>de Marca,</hi> Son to that Illuſtrious Prelat and Preſident of the Parliament of <hi>Paris;</hi> he therein further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms us, that this Letter of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> is in the cuſtody of Monſr. <hi>Bigot,</hi> who in his Voyage into <hi>Italy</hi> found it in the Library, whence <hi>Peter Martyr</hi> of <hi>Florence</hi> formerly procur'd it, I mean in the Library of the Duke of <hi>Florence;</hi> ſo that for the future there ought not to be any farther Conteſt of the validity of this Letter, becauſe the true Author of it cannot be unknown. <hi>Theodoret,</hi> a great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirer of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Theod. dial. 2.</note> tells us: <q>That the Nature of the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols is not changed.</q> And in another of his Dialogues, <q>The Myſtical Symbols, ſaith he, after Conſecration do not change their proper Nature, for they continue in their former Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,

Yet it muſt be confeſſed there is to be found in the Writings of the Antients, a Paſſage where the Author, be he who he will, ſeems to differ from this Belief, univerſally received by the Church in his Time; it is in an Eaſter Sermon, attributed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Caeſarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Arles,</hi> who lived in the ſixth Century, although it be not certain whether it be his or not; but ſo 'tis that in this Sermon amongſt other things it is ſaid:
<note place="margin">Ceſar. Hom. 1. de Paſch.</note> 
                     <q>That the inviſible Prieſt (he means Jeſus Chriſt) changeth by the ſecret Power of his Word the viſible Creatures into the Subſtance of his Body and Blood.</q> Some would anſwer, that the private Opinion of <hi>Caeſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius</hi> ſhould not take place againſt the many Teſtimonies above al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged, not being juſt that one ſhould be preferred before ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the greater part whereof were nothing inferiour unto <hi>Caeſarius</hi> in Dignity and Learning, and ſome ſurpaſſed him both in one and the other, as St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and Pope <hi>Gelaſius;</hi> others in Dignity at leaſt, as St. <hi>Ephraim</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Antioch,</hi> not to mention his Learning, which in all likelihood was nothing ſhort of <hi>Caeſarius,</hi> if he were truly the Authour of the Sermon which we examine; and others in fine in Learning, as <hi>Theodoret,</hi> whoſe Light and Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg was incomparably greater: and they would not fail here to apply that Maxime of <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis,</hi>

<pb n="208" facs="tcp:47504:127"/>of a few more, ſhould firſt be oppoſed the Decree of an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Council, if there be any. Secondly, if there are none, let the Opinion of ſeveral great Doctors, that do agree amongſt themſelves, be followed; for, ſaith he, whatſoever is believed by one particular Perſon, above or againſt what is received and allowed by all, be he Saint, Doctor, Biſhop, Confeſſor, or Martyr, let it be reputed a low, peculiar, and cloſe Thing, private and particular to himſelf, and let it not have the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of an Opinion commonly, publickly, and generally recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved.</q> This is what ſeveral might anſwer unto this Difficulty, and their Anſwer would not be contemptible: Others think more kindneſs may be ſhew'd unto <hi>Caeſarius,</hi> in reconciling him with the reſt rather than reject him; for they conceive this Act of Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity is due unto an Author to give a favourable Conſtruction to his Words, and not to make him claſh with the Opinion generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, which ought eſpecially take place in things that regard the eſſential Parts of Piety and Religion; becauſe in thoſe Things, without endangering our Salvation, we cannot ſeparate from the Belief which hath been always received in the Church of God. Let us ſee then how they would reconcile <hi>Caeſarius</hi> with thoſe other glorious Witneſſes above-mentioned: It may eaſily be done, ſay they, if you conſider, that the Fathers often ſpeak as <hi>Caeſarius</hi> did, although they only underſtand a Change of Quality, which befals the Subſtance wherein this change is made,
<note place="margin">Tertul. cont. Marc. l. 3. &amp; l. 1. ad Uxor.</note> though nevertheleſs it is not changed it ſelf; for inſtance, <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid, <hi>That we ſhall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into an Angelical Subſtance;</hi> inſtead of ſaying, <hi>that we ſhall be chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into an Angelical Quality,</hi> as he elſewhere explains himſelf.

                     <hi>that ſhe was transformed into an incorruptible and Angelical Subſtance;</hi> to ſignify, <hi>that ſhe had acquired Angelical Qualities,</hi> in reſpect whereof ſhe might aſſume the Name of <hi>Angelical Subſtance.</hi> So St. <hi>Auſtin,
<note place="margin">Aug. in Pſal. 68.

And St. <hi>Peter Chryſologus,</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the change hapned in the human Nature of Chriſt by the Refurrection,
<note place="margin">Chryſolog. Hom. 82.</note> ſaith, <hi>that our Lord changed Subſtance,</hi> which is not true but in regard of Qualities. But to come nearer the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, all Chriſtians generally confeſs, that the Water of Baptiſm doth not loſe its Subſtance,
<note place="margin">Tertull. de Baptiſm.</note> yet that hinders not but <hi>Tertullian</hi> calls Baptiſm, <hi>a divine Subſtance,</hi> becauſe the Waters of Baptiſm recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving by Conſecration the Holineſs which they had not, they are ſaid in ſome fort to paſs into the divine Subſtance, it being reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that the Subject ſhould derive its Name from its beſt and moſt
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:47504:127"/>noble part. What then may hinder, but <hi>Caeſarius</hi> might ſay in a good ſenſe of the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament, <q>That Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt doth change them into the Subſtance of his Body and Blood,</q> although the Bread and Wine keep their Subſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he makes them paſs into the efficacy of his own Fleſh, as St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſpeaks. Certainly it ought not to be thought ſtrange, if they conſider that Pope <hi>Gelaſius,</hi> who wrote about 50 Years before <hi>Caeſarius,

He caſt himſelf at the Feet of St. <hi>Milain,</hi> and told him what was happened; the holy Biſhop wept for him all Night, Watching and Praying, and next Day gave him Abſolution, and the Bleſſing, and preſently after the Serpent took again the Form of the Euchariſt, and St. <hi>Marſus</hi> taking it, he communicated with Joy, which he neglected to do to his Damage.</q> It is plain that the Euchariſt, here mentioned, is nothing elſe but the Bread of the Euchariſt, which St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> commonly calls by that Name: In ſhort, this Euchariſt was intended for the Communion, as appears by the whole Story. Therefore St. <hi>Milain</hi> gave unto each of them a Portion; it alſo appears that <hi>Marſus</hi> had received ſome Tincture, that the receiving the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment broke the Faſt, and I find not but the other Biſhops were of the ſame Mind. All that is blam'd in <hi>Marſus,</hi> is the having preferr'd the Faſt of the Day before the Communion, whereas he ought to have preferr'd the Communion before the Faſt; that is to ſay, that it was better to have communicated with the others, and broke his Faſt as they had done, than to deprive himſelf of the Sacrament

                  <p>HAving ſeen what was believed and ſaid in this ſpatious and vaſt Country of Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, of the things received in the Sacrament; and having examined the Reflections which the Doctors of that Empire have made upon the Words of Inſtitution of this Divine and Auguſt Sacrament; we are obliged to enquire what they have taught of the Uſe, Office, and employ of theſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Symbols, I mean of the Bread and Wine. If we will ſearch into their Records, wherein the Laws and Maxims of this Kingdom may be found, we ſhall ſee that thoſe which have had the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Direction of it, have conceived that the Euchariſt is the Sacrament, the Sign, the Figure, the Type, the Anti-type, the Symbol, the Image, the Similitude, and the Reſemblance of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt: It's true, 'tis not enough to ſay ſo, the Reader muſt moreover ſee the Teſtimonies where the holy Fathers ſay ſo, for 'tis their Opinions are now in queſtion, and not ours.

Alas! God forbid we ſhould ever do them the Injuſtice as to think ſo. In ſhort, if they taught that the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament are Images and Figures, they judged them not to be empty Figures, which had no other uſe nor virtue, but to ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Eyes ſome form that may be like the Original whereof they are Figures, like the Images and Pictures which are to be ſeen in Painters and Carvers Shops; they have firmly believed that they are Signs inſtituted by God, and conſequently accompanied with his Grace and Benediction, which makes them efficacious unto thoſe which receive them worthily, and that with holy diſpoſitions draw near unto the Myſtical Table.

And it is in relation to this Efficacy and Vertue whereof we have treated, that the Fathers call the Euchariſt, <q>The <hi>Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> ſaying, that the Bread and Wine paſs into his Body and Blood; that they change, and are tranſelemented in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Body and Blood.</q> They alſo uſe other expreſſions, which in effect amount to the ſame, all which the <hi>Latins</hi> expound to their advantage, and which they make the chief ground of their Belief; But becauſe theſe laſt Expreſſions at firſt ſight ſeem inconſiſtent with what they ſaid unto us before, that the Euchariſt is true Bread and real Wine, Bread which is broken, that nouriſhes the Body, which is converted into our Subſtance, Bread which is ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, that is conſumed in the celebration of the Sacrament, whoſe
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:47504:134"/>Subſtance remains, and that paſſeth as to its material part, by the ſordid way of our ordinary and common Food; that this Bread and this Wine are the Signs, the Symbols, the Types, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>types, the Sacraments, the Figures, the Images, the Reſemblances, and the Repreſentations of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; not vain Figures, and empty and void Signs without any effect and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; but Signs and Sacraments repleniſhed (as may be ſaid) with all the Vertue, and all the Efficacy of the Body broken, and the Blood of our Lord poured out; who having inſtituted them to be the Inſtruments and Organs of our Salvation, doth accompany their lawful uſe with his Bleſſing and Grace, to beſtow upon us the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of the enlivening Sacrifice of his Death, which Merit ought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to be ſeparated from his Body, ſeeing it was by the ſufferings of his broken Body, and his Blood poured out, that he merited for us this quickning and ſaving Vertue: For this Reaſon, I ſay, it will be very neceſſary to clear up this Difficulty, and to remove this ſeeming Contradiction; I ſay ſeeming, for I make no queſtion but the Fathers themſelves will ſufficiently inform us of their Intention, and that we ſhall find in their Works, Lights, by which we ſhall ſafely conduct the Reader to the clear and diſtinct knowledg of the belief of the antient Church upon this Article of our Salvation. Thoſe who are any thing verſt in reading their Works, doubtleſs do obſerve that when they ſay, the Sacrament is Bread and Wine, they never intimate that it is a figurative, improper, and equivocal Expreſſion, and that it muſt not be taken according to the Letter, neither do they ſay that the Sacrament is called Bread and Wine, altho it is not ſo after Conſecration, becauſe it was ſo in effect, and ſtill retains the Accidents and Likeneſs: For my part, I inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly confeſs, that I have never found ſuch Cautions, or Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements in their Works.

                  <p>Hitherto theſe Holy Fathers have not ill informed us of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of this manner of Speech, that the Euchariſt is the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, but nevertheleſs they intend not to reſt there, they will moreover inform us wherefore it is ſo uſed in the Church.

<note place="margin">Aug. Ep. 23. ad Bonif.</note> 
                     <q>If the Sacraments (ſaith he) had not ſome reſemblance unto the things whereof they be Sacraments, they would be no Sacraments; and it is becauſe of this likeneſs, that they often take the Names of the things themſelves; as then the Sacrament of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Sacrament of his Blood, are <hi>after ſome ſort,</hi> his Body and Blood, ſo the Sacrament of Faith is Faith.</q> He means, that the Euchariſt ſhould be the Body and Blood of Chriſt, by reaſon of the reſemblance which there is betwixt them, as the Sacrament of Faith (that is to ſay Baptiſm) is called Faith; and as the Fridays before <hi>Eaſter</hi> are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Paſſion of our Lord; and the repreſentation of his Death, which is made in the celebration of the Sacrament, his Death it ſelf: He inſtanced theſe two Examples of this kind of Speech in what preceded that which hath been cited. I will not here ſtand to ſhew that the Fathers ground this reſemblance, ſome in the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of Bread and Wine, and others in their Effects, becauſe we have done it in the firſt Chapter of the firſt part.

                  <argument>
                     <p>A Continuance of the Doctrine of the Holy Fathers.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ALthough the Holy Fathers have hitherto ſufficiently explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves, and that they have fully declared what was their Belief touching the Nature of the Euchariſt, in ſaying, That it is true Bread, and true Wine; and that this Bread and Wine are the Signs, the Images, and the Figures of the Body and Blood of our Lord; but Signs accompanied, if it may be ſo ſaid, with the Majeſty of his own Perſon, and filled with the quickning Vertue of his Divine Body broken for us, called his Body and Blood by reaſon of the Reſemblance, becauſe they are the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols and Sacraments, the Memorials of his Perſon, and of his Death, becauſe they are unto us inſtead of his Body and Blood, and paſs into a Sacrament of this holy Body and precious Blood, and are changed into their Efficacy and Vertue: nevertheleſs if we can diſcover what were the Conſequences of this Doctrine, I doubt not but it will yet receive greater Illuſtration. For as it is impoſſiſible that they ſhould have believed the Converſion of the Subſtance of Bread and Wine into the Subſtance of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, without admitting the three following Doctrines; to wit, the eating of the Fleſh of Chriſt with the Mouth of the Body; the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this ſame Fleſh by the Wicked, as well as the Juſt; and the Human Preſence of Chriſt upon Earth: So it is alſo impoſſible they ſhould deny theſe three Poſitions, without rejecting this ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Converſion: Therefore I ſuppoſe it is neceſſary to enquire ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly what they herein believed; for if they have received them as Articles of their Belief, it will be a great Conjecture in Favour of the ſubſtantial Converſion, notwithſtanding what they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready declared: But if on the other hand, they have rejected them, or been far from admitting of them, it will be a very great Conjecture to the contrary, and at the ſame Time a ſtrong Confirmation of what they have depoſed in the precedent Chapters. To begin then our Enquiry by the firſt of theſe three Points, I mean by the eating of the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt; I ſay, if we conſult <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> we ſhall find he makes a long Diſcourſe in the firſt Book of his <hi>Pedagoge,</hi> and that in all that Diſcourſe he conſiders Jeſus Chriſt, either as the Milk of Children, that is to ſay, thoſe which are Children in Knowledge; or as the Meat of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:47504:139"/>firm grown Men, that is, more advanced in Knowledge; but al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways as a Spiritual Food, and myſtical Nouriſhment, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires to be eaten after the ſame manner, as appears by what he ſaith of the Birth and Regeneration of the new People, of the Swadling-cloths wherein he wraps them, of the Growth for which he appoints them this Food, and in that he makes our Hearts to be the Palace and Temple of the Son of God; Hereunto particularly relates what he ſaith, that the Lord in theſe Words of the Goſpel of St. <hi>John;</hi>

And elſewhere he ſaith, That 'tis to drink the Blood of Chriſt, to be Partaker of the Incorruption of our Lord; which he attributes to the entring of the Holy Ghoſt into our Hearts.</q>

                     <p>Continuation of the Conſequences of the Doctrine of the Fathers.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ALthough what we have examined in the foregoing Chapter, doth fully juſtify that the Holy Fathers have been conſtant in their Doctrine, and that the Conſequences which depend upon it are abſolutely conformable unto the Principles which they have ſet down; Nevertheleſs, becauſe there be ſeveral others which we have not touched, we find our ſelves abſolutely obliged to handle them in this Chapter, the better to clear the Truth which we ſeek for, and if in what remains to be examined, they have ſaid any thing which might favour the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the real Converſion, which the <hi>Latins</hi> have made an Article of their Faith, it is certain, that what they have ſaid hitherto will not be of ſo much moment, and will loſe of its worth and vertue; whereas if nothing can be found, in what is yet to be ſeen, contrary unto what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready examined, it muſt then be neceſſarily concluded, ſay the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants, that there is nothing in all their Writings that agrees with the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church: In fine, if theſe Holy Doctors have believed the change of the Subſtance of Bread and Wine into the Subſtance of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, then they muſt alſo have admitted of theſe following Maxims; Firſt, That a Body may be in ſeveral Places at once; but far from admitting this Maxim to be true, they directly oppoſe it. <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> diſputing againſt the Heretick <hi>Hermogenes,</hi> which made the Creature co-eternal unto God,

                     <hi>Arnobius</hi> was ſo ſtrongly of <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Opinion, that he uſes it as a Principle univerſally received, to refute the Evaſion of <hi>Pagans,</hi> who taught that their Gods were in all the Images

Secondly, according to the Doctrine of the <hi>Latins,</hi> the Body of Jeſus Chriſt muſt exiſt in the Sacrament after the manner of a Spirit, inviſibly, and without occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pying any ſpace; if the Fathers were of this Opinion, they would not have failed to have left us proofs in their Writings, or if they were obliged to ſay the contrary of Bodies in general, and when they conſidered them in the Order of Nature, they would doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs have brought ſome exception touching the glorious Body of our Lord Jeſus: they were too prudent and too wiſe to forget ſo conſiderable a Circumſtance, the ſilence whereof might have been of very dangerous conſequence, and have done notable prejudice unto their Doctrine; ſo that having exactly conſidered what they have ſaid of Bodies in general, and in regarding what they be na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, it appears they have made no Exception for the Body of Chriſt; it follows then of neceſſity, as the Proteſtants ſay, that they believed not that it could exiſt after the manner of a Spirit, that is to ſay, inviſibly and without filling a ſpace, according to the meaſure of its dimenſions; this is what I could diſcover in the Monuments of Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, which we have remaining, touching this Queſtion, which is that the Holy Fathers teſtify, <q>That 'tis impoſſible, that that which hath neither Bounds,

<pb n="250" facs="tcp:47504:148"/>after the Reſurrection, after the which he may be in the Sacrament after the manner of a Spirit, inviſibly, and without taking up of any ſpace, and without that each part of this Divine Body ſhould anſwer unto each part of the place which ſhould be proportioned unto its greatneſs and compaſs: Nevertheleſs, the Truth is, ſay they, that no ſuch thing hath ever been found in their Writings, and that no exception can be found for the Body of our glorious Redeemer. Shall we ſay that they have therein wanted Wiſdom and Conduct, but they think this would be to ſtop the courſe of their Glory, and to ſlander the great Reputation they have acquired in the Church of God, that it would render them uſeleſs in the Controverſies which divide Chriſtians in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> becauſe upon each point in diſpute, ſome of either ſide may tax them with the like thing and make them Parties. It were much better, ſay they, to confeſs ſincerely that they believed not that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt could exiſt after the manner of a Spirit, nor any other manner than as Bodies are wont to exiſt, becauſe that after his Reſurrection, he would have his Apoſtles know by ſeeing and feeling, that he had a true Body. In the third place, it is another Conſequence of the Belief of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which was formed ſo long agoe in the Womb of the Virgin, by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, is made every day by pronouncing theſe Words unto which the <hi>Latins</hi> attribute the Conſecration of the Sacrament.

But beſides all theſe Conſequences which we have examined, there is yet a ſixth, againſt which it is ſaid the Holy Fathers have no leſs abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves: It regards the depoſition of our Senſes, againſt which the <hi>Latin</hi> Church doth oppoſe it ſelf, commanding not to believe them, when they tell us that what we ſee upon the Holy Table, and that what we receive there for the Comfort and Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our Souls, is Bread and Wine, becauſe it is not in effect nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the one or the other, but appearances deſtitute of the Truth, and that the Senſes are deceived when they make us this falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port.

<pb n="257" facs="tcp:47504:151"/>Men, but above all, not to ſhake the ſolid Foundation of the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of Jeſus Chriſt; Is it poſſible, that thoſe People could have been of the belief of the <hi>Latin</hi> Church touching the Sacrament? for every one knows, this Church declares it ſelf againſt the ſimplicity of their Teſtimony, that they accuſe of Infidelity theſe faithful Witneſſes, and endeavour to deprive them of being believed amongſt Chriſtians, becauſe that being perſuaded of their Verity, and the Truth of their Depoſition, it will have much adoe to ſupport and defend it ſelf, and yet more difficulty of inſinuating into the Minds of thoſe which do not queſtion the belief of them. But it may be, ſome will ſay, probably the Fathers have excepted in this Diſpute of the Teſtimony of the Senſes, the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, as a particular thing, and which ought not to be reckoned along with the reſt; if it be ſo, it is not fit to keep it ſecret, nor to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue againſt the Faith of the <hi>Latins</hi> of what they have ſaid in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Senſes; this difficulty which may eaſily be fancied in the minds of many, hath obliged me exactly to enquire into their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, if they have not ſaid any thing which may inform us of their Intentions; and having made a ſtrict ſearch into all parts, I find they have eſtabliſhed the Fidelity of this ſame Teſtimony of the Senſes in what relates to the Sacrament.

As to the Signs and Symbols, they alſo ſay, that they have therein alſo diſtinguiſhed two things, the Subſtance and their Nature, and their Uſe and Employment; that is to ſay, the quality of the Sacraments wherewith they are qualified by fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the Benediction: For example, in Baptiſm they pretend that Water which is the Symbol, hath two Relations, one of the bare Element, of the Nature which keeps its Subſtance, and the other of the Sacrament of Religion, which Conſecration gives it. It is the ſame in the Euchariſt, for beſides the Nature and Subſtance of Bread and Wine, which are the Signs and Symbols, they bear the quality of Sacraments of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and it is Grace which God adds unto Nature: Now to apply this unto our Subject, they ſay, that the Senſes being Organs purely Natural, they cannot lift themſelves above Nature, nor make us a true report of what doth not depend upon their Laws, but whilſt they keep within the bounds of their Nature, and that they un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake nothing beyond their Strength, and the Priviledges granted unto them, their Teſtimony is infallible, and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition true and certain; therefore, when they ſhew us that the Water in Baptiſm is truly Water, according to its Subſtance, and the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt, but Bread and Wine alſo in regard of their Subſtance; they judge, that we ought to believe them, after what the Fathers have told us, becauſe then they do not paſs the limits that God hath ſet them; but when they will paſs further, and tell us that the Water of Baptiſm is but bare Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the Bread and Wine of the Sacrament but bare Bread and Wine, we ſhould command their ſilence, becauſe they paſs beyond their Bounds, and paſſing beyond the Limits of Nature, they take upon them to penetrate into the Myſteries of Grace, which have been only given unto Faith to diſpoſe of; they alſo obſerve, that 'tis in theſe occaſions that the ſame Fathers forbid us to hearken unto them, or receive their Teſtimony, and that 'tis ſo muſt be underſtood, the Author of the Book of them which are initiated,

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:47504:153"/>things which are therein contained.</q> This Similitude, ſay they, is juſt and conducts us unto the true knowledg of what we ſearch for; for it is unto our Sences in regard of the Sacraments, as it was unto this ignorant Man in regard of a Letter; for as this Man receiving a Letter, ſaid it was Paper and Ink, which is very true; ſo alſo our Senſes contemplating the Sacraments, aſſure us that it is Water, Bread, and Wine, ſo far their Teſtimony is faithful: but as this ſame Man is deceived, when he ſays that 'tis nothing but Paper and Ink, becauſe he hath not the Gift neceſſary to penetrate the ſenſe and meaning: Even ſo alſo, our Senſes go aſtray, when they ſay that 'tis but meer Water, and Bread, and Wine; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they keep not within the Limits of their own Sphere, and that they raſhly undertake to know that which is not at all within the nature of their Object, we muſt then, ſay they, to end this Difficulty, receive their Teſtimony in the Affirmative, and reject their Teſtimony in the Negative, that is to ſay, they muſt be heard when their report toucheth only the matter and ſubſtance of the Symbols, to affirm that there is Water in Baptiſm, and Bread and Wine in the Euchariſt; but not when they ſay, that it is but only Water, Bread and Wine; for they do not underſtand the reaſon of the Myſtery, nor the quality of the Sacraments of Jeſus Chriſt, wherewith Conſecration hath inveſted them. I cannot paſs over in ſilence two Obſervations of the ſame St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> becauſe they may both ſerve to the illuſtrating the matter in hand; by the firſt he teacheth us, that to make a Sacrament, ſomething viſible muſt be eſtabliſhed, that may be truly what it appears to be, and which beſides muſt lift up our Faith to the meditation of ſomething elſe that we do not ſee,

                  <p>ALthough we have hitherto repreſented ſeveral Things which have been believed and practiſed in the Country of Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, yet it is not all which I obſerved during the Time of my reſiding in that Country; I will then continue the Hiſtory of my Travels, not to conceal any Thing from the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick of the Laws and Cuſtoms of that ſpacious Empire, upon the Point which we have undertaken to examine. For it would not be juſt, after having had Communication of their Records and Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, wherein all that relates unto this auguſt Sacrament is faithfully contained, that I ſhould omit any Thing that I have there found: not to fail then of my Duty, nor the fidelity due to the Quality which I have taken; I ſay that beſides the Things which I have already obſerved, I find that about two hundred Years after the firſt Beginning of this great Empire, thoſe which had the Direction and Government of it, applied their Thoughts very much in giving divers myſtical Significations unto the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament, and that thoſe which followed them applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thereunto alſo; for they thought, that the Bread of the Euchariſt being a Body compoſed of ſeveral Grains, and the Wine a Liquor preſſed from ſeveral Grapes, they very well re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented the Body of the Church, compoſed of ſeveral Believers united into one Society.

See there after what manner he underſtands this conſtant Doctrine of the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Moreover, he deſires to be ſuffered to add, that what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms him in this Opinion, is, That if any other Senſe be given unto this Doctrine of the ancient Fathers, this Inconvenience will ſcarce be avoided, to wit, that one ſhall be forced to ſay of the true and proper Body of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>This Bread compoſed of ſundry Grains, repreſents unto us the Church compoſed of ſundry Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers;</hi> which Thing truly Chriſtian Ears would ſcarce be able to endure. Beſides, we have obſerved in the firſt Chapter of the firſt Part, that the ancient Church was wont to mingle Water with the Wine in the Celebration of the Sacrament; and that in the beginning of the third Century there was a Myſtery ſought for in this Mixture: The Reader may pleaſe to view the Place where even thoſe of the holy Fathers are named, which have ſo ſpoken; it being need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs here to repeat what hath been there mentioned, but only to make ſome few Reflections which we were not there permitted to do; and which nevertheleſs may ſerve very much to clear up the Intention of theſe holy Doctors. The firſt is, That they have given two ſeveral Significations unto the Water, and the Wine, ſaying, That the Water repreſents the faithful People, and the Wine the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt: For I cannot conceive, that theſe two Uſages could take place, if both theſe Things did not remain diſtinct the one from the other, becauſe each of them hath a ſeveral Object to repreſent, ſo that the one of them can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not repreſent the Object which the other doth ſignifie. Secondly, they have eſtabliſhed betwixt the Wine and the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the ſame Relation which they have eſtabliſhed betwixt the Water and the faithful People, it not being to be ſeen that they have given any more Vertue unto the Wine to ſignifie the Blood of the Son of God, than they have given to the Water to repreſent the Chriſtian People, and without giving notice, that the Wine is the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt in a more particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than the Water is the faithful People. On the contrary, they have ſpoken ſo equally of them, both in regard of the two Sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifications which they attributed unto them, that it is impoſſible to diſcover the leaſt difference. In fine, the holy Fathers declare,
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:47504:156"/>That the Wine and Water mingled together, ſignifie the Union of Jeſus Chriſt and Believers, which they could not diſcern, but in the Thoughts of the Union of theſe two Elements; I ſpeak of the Water and Wine, which ſubſiſted firm and indiſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; and the Firmneſs of the Union of theſe two Things could not ſubſiſt, if their Nature, and the Truth of their Being, did not ſubſiſt alſo. And to ſay the Truth as far as I can judge, theſe good Doctors have not made this Signification which they gave to the Wine and Water, to depend barely upon their mingling only, but principally of the Subſiſtance of this Mixture, which was abſolutely neceſſary, that it might repreſent the Truth and Solidity of the ſpiritual Union of Jeſus Chriſt and his People. There is an admirable fine Paſſage of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> upon this Subject, but which I ſhall diſpenſe my ſelf from inſerting here, becauſe 'tis to be ſeen at large in the Place above-mention'd. Whilſt I ſhall join unto this myſtical Signification two others, which we have touched in the ſame Place in the firſt Part. By the one, the Wine and Water mingled in the conſecrated Cup, were to repreſent the Water and Blood which run down the Side of our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus at the time of his Paſſion; and by the other, the Union of the Eternal Word with the Humanity: But all theſe myſtical Significations are deſtroyed, if the Nature and Subſtance of Things are aboliſhed, in the which they had their only Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. After this manner the Proteſtant doth reaſon upon theſe Obſervations.</p>

Univerſally agree; <hi>Athenagoras,</hi> ſay they, could not believe, that the Bodies of Believers after the Reſurrection ſhould have no Blood, but that he believed alſo, that the glorified Body of Chriſt had none alſo; and if he believed it had none, how could it be thought that he believed that it ſhould be drank in the Euchariſt but figuratively, becauſe we there make a Commemoration of that Blood which he ſhed upon the Croſs for the Expiation of our Sins. A Commemoration which we could not make, as St. <hi>Paul</hi> commands us, unleſs we participate of the Fruits and Benefits of his bitter Death: A Participation, which, as the Proteſtants ſay, is the Effect of the ſpiritual and myſtical Eating, or if you will, Drinking;
<note place="margin">Hieron. Ep. 61. c. 8, 9, &amp;c. 1.2.</note> but alſo at the ſame time a real and true Eating, which is done by our Faith.

<note place="margin">Aug. Epiſt. 146. ad Conſ. init.</note> had Blood? For we find by one of the Letters of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> which one <hi>Conſentius</hi> wrote unto him to be inform'd, <hi>if the Body of Chriſt now hath Blood and Bones.</hi> This <hi>Conſentius</hi> was not an Ordinary Believer, or common Chriſtian, he ſeems to be a Biſhop, or
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:47504:157"/>at leaſt a Prieſt worthy of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s Reſpect and Friendſhip; for in the Beginning of the Letter he gives him the Title of <hi>moſt dear, or most beloved:</hi> And elſewhere he ſaith unto him, <hi>That he is beloved in the Bowels of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> I freely confeſs,
<note place="margin">Ep. 222.</note> ſaith the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant, I cannot read theſe Words, without thinking of the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Latin Church in the Point of the Sacrament; for it is not to be conceived, that one of the Conducters of the Chriſtian Churches, ſhould propoſe unto the great St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſo ridiculous and impertinent a Queſtion, if it was believed in his Time of the Sacrament, as is now believed by the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks. In fine, if it was the Belief of the fifth Century, I cannot ſee how that Man can be excus'd of Folly and Extravagance. Nevertheleſs on the other hand, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> deals by him in ſuch a manner, which ſuffers us not to judge ſo diſadvantagiouſly of him. What ſhall we then ſay, Continues he, to excuſe the Simplicity of this Man, and to give ſome Colour to his Demand? Had he never participated of the Euchariſt, had he never approached unto the holy Table, and had he never drank of the Cup of our Redemption? Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore then doth he ask of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> to know, <hi>if the glorified Body of our Lord hath Blood,</hi> if it were true, that the Church at that time held for an Article of Faith, That it was drank really and truly every time as they communicated of the holy Cup? Or, wherefore doth not St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> refer him back unto the Sacrament? the only Conſideration whereof might have ſatisfied <hi>Conſentius,</hi> if the Belief of the Latins had been the Belief of that Age. Let us proceed; St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> proves unto his Friend by the Words of the Scriptures, That the Body of Jeſus Chriſt hath yet now Fleſh and Bones; but becauſe in the Scripture he cites, there is no mention of Blood, he leaves this Point in the Terms <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentius</hi> left it; that is to ſay, in ſuſpenſe; ſaying, That becauſe Jeſus Chriſt only ſaid, <hi>That he had Fleſh and Bones,</hi> without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Blood, we ſhould not alſo extend our Queſtion any farther, nor add that of his Blood unto the other of his Fleſh and Bones; <hi>Fearing,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>there ſhould come ſome other more inquiſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:47504:158"/>and abuſing the Memory of the other. The other is to own, That neither St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> nor <hi>Conſentius</hi> could have ſpoken as they did, and believe what is now believed by the Latin Church. There is ſcatter'd here and there in the Writings of the Ancients, ſeveral Things of this Nature, from whence may be drawn Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences for the Knowledge of what they believed. In this Rank may be placed the Reproach made againſt the Orthodox in St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Auguſt. contra Fauſt. l. 20. c. 13.</note> which we touched in Chap. III.

<note place="margin">Id. ibid.</note> but that this Bread and Wine did not regard, nor relate unto <hi>Ceres</hi> and <hi>Bacchus. Although</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>it is Bread and Wine, yet they have no Relation unto thoſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Idols.</hi> I add unto this Reproach the <hi>Accuſation</hi> of <hi>Rabbi Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin</hi> in St. <hi>Iſidor</hi> of <hi>Damieta,</hi> mentioned by us in the ſame Place;
<note place="margin">Iſid. Pelus l. 1.

If the Oblation of the Church had been not an Oblation of Bread, but an Oblation of the real Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; that it was the only Way this ancient Doctor could take to ſtop the Mouth of this inſolent <hi>Jew,</hi> if the Belief of Chriſtians of his Time had been truly ſo, there needs only common Senſe to conclude thus.

But what appearance is there, that although he was not ſo Eminent as his Adverſary, yet he had his Talents and Gifts? How could he be ignorant of what was not hidden from the moſt Simple and Ignorant amongſt the People? Beſides, St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Anſwer gives us ſufficiently to underſtand, that <hi>Jovinian</hi>'s Reaſoning was well and ſolidly grounded, and that he ſuppoſed a Principle univerſally received by all Chriſtians. In fine, however conſiderable a Man St. <hi>Jerom</hi> was, and whatever Reſpect we owe unto his Memory, yet we may ſay, without wronging him, that he had his Failings; <hi>ſeeing there's no Man without his Faults, and happy is he that hath feweſt,</hi> as ſaith the Poet. The moſt remarkable Fault in St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> was his Paſſion againſt his Adverſaries, and too great Earneſtneſs in diſputing, which ſometimes tranſporting him beyond the Bounds of Reaſon, inſpired him with very injurious and outragious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions.
<note place="margin">Id. ibid c. 11.</note> It is then very likely he would not have ſpared <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinian,</hi> if his Opinion had been contrary unto that of the Church; and but that he would preſently have cried, Ah the Heretick! Nevertheleſs, he doth not do ſo. On the contrary, he anſwers after a manner, which plainly ſhews, that in this Point he was of the ſame Opinion with <hi>Jovinian. Although that Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was hungry and thirſty, and that he was many times at
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:47504:159"/>Feaſts, yet it is not written, that he pleaſed his Mouth, nor his Belly, if you except the Myſtery which he ſhewed in Type of his Paſſion.</hi> We have ſpoken in the ſecond Chapter of our firſt Part, of two ſorts of Chriſtians which uſed only Water in the Euchariſt, beſides the <hi>Encratites,</hi> of whom we will ſay nothing in this Place. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in the Morning Aſſemblies abſtained from the Uſe of Wine in the Celebration of the Sacrament, becauſe they feared leaſt the Smell of it ſhould diſcover them to be Chriſtians, and People which came from participating of the Euchariſt; and that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering them to be ſuch,
<note place="margin">Cyprian Ep. 63.</note> it might expoſe them to the Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the Heathens. <hi>It may be</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Cyprian</hi>) <hi>that ſome may fear at the Morning Oblation to make known by the Scent of the Wine, that he hath participated of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Was ever any Fear ſo ill grounded, or any pannick Fear like this? If it had then been believed, that what was drank in communicating, was the real Blood of Chriſt, where was the Senſe of thoſe People, to be afraid of a Shadow, and to tremble where there was no Cauſe of Danger? Seeing it could not be ſaid, that the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt had the ſame Smell that Wine had; and that moreover it is expreſly ſpoken of the Smell of Wine, and not of the Odour of the Blood of Chriſt. And what ſurpriſeth them yet more, is, that thoſe of whom we ſpeak, were not pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ordinary Perſons, but Conducters alſo; for St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns ſuch, at the Beginning of his Treatiſe, by thoſe which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the Cup of the Lord, and diſtribute it unto the People. To ſay that the Smell of Wine ſhould reſt in the Sacrament, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though there had been no Wine, that could not be; becauſe the Holy Fathers before declared, That Accidents could not exiſt without their Subjects, without ever excepting the Sacrament. Moreover, when St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> condemned this Abuſe, as doubtleſs he had reaſon to condemn it; wherefore had he not ſaid, That thoſe People were the moſt to blame that could be, to take for Wine, the proper Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and to think, that the Sacrament had the Scent of Wine, ſeeing there was no Wine in it? Wherefore had he not alledged againſt them the Belief of the Univerſal Church, if it held for an Article of Faith, that what is contained in the myſtical Cup, is not Wine after Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, but the very Subſtance of the Blood of the Son of God. It was, ſay they, the only Means that could have been uſed to have made them aſhamed, and to have reclaimed them from their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; yet nevertheleſs St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> doth not make uſe of it: He contents himſelf to pity their Ignorance and their Timidity, and to blame them, that they had not followed the Example of Jeſus Chriſt, who had not uſed Water alone in his Euchariſt, nor
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:47504:159"/>Wine alone, but of both. The other Chriſtians which celebrated the Sacrament with Water, did it by another Motive, as <hi>Genna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> hath informed us, when he told us,
<note place="margin">De dogm. Eccleſ. c. 75.</note> 
                     <hi>That they did ſo under a Pretext of Sobriety.</hi> Is it poſſble that this Thought could ever come into the Mind of a Chriſtian, that to drink the Blood of the Lord Jeſus, was to want Sobriety? What were Men made of in thoſe Times, ſay the Proteſtants? Had they common Senſe and Reaſon as we have? For we cannot conceive their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings; it muſt be freely confeſſed, if participating of the Holy Cup, they believe they drink the pure Blood of the Son of God, and not Wine; how they could think, that under a Pretext of Sobriety, that they ought to uſe only Water therein? But where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had not the Holy Fathers taken Care better to inſtruct and inform them herein? it had been their Duty and Charity to have cured theſe Souls from this miſtaken Niceneſs which cauſed them to err: they alſo did it; for they were too zealous and charitable to let themly in Error: But how have they done it? was it in ſaying unto them, That the holy Liquor in the Sacramental Cup is no longer Wine, but the proper Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; no, at leaſt no ſuch Thing is ſeen in their Writings, to think ſo. On the contrary, you would think they take Delight in ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it is Wine:

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:47504:160"/>that the Reproach he made unto <hi>Laban</hi> was neither prudent nor judicious, becauſe he might have been anſwered, That the ſame might befal his God. And indeed others before me have obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,

<note place="margin">Theodoret. in Geneſ.

If he had believed, that the proper Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which all Chriſtians adore, and unto whom they addreſs the Soveraign Worſhip of their Religion, were truly and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eaten with the Mouth of the Body:
<note place="margin">Id. in Levit. Queſt. 11. p. 124.</note> For if that were ſo, ſay they, with what Face could he ſay, <hi>That it is the higheſt Folly to adore what we eat?</hi> And again when he asks this Queſtion, <hi>Where is there any Man of good Senſe, that can call that his God, which he eateth himſelf after having offered it unto the true God?</hi> Had it not been to have expoſed himſelf to the Scorn of the Enemies of Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and have given them Occaſion to have derided the Holineſs of our Myſteries? I could add unto all that we have ſaid, in the firſt place, the Simplicity with which the primitive Chriſtians ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated the Sacrament, as we ſhall perceive by <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> and the Liturgy of the pretended <hi>Dennis</hi> the <hi>Areopagite;</hi> for it is very like, if they had believed that the Sacrament is the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, they would have uſed more Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in the Celebration. Secondly, The Form of Conſecration uſed in the ancient Church, as well in the Eaſt as the Weſt, by Prayers, Invocations, and giving Thanks, as hath been ſhewn in the ſeventh Chapter of the firſt Part, doth ſhew in all likelihood, that the Doctrine of the ſubſtantial Converſion was not believed, becauſe this Converſion could not be made without the aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Subſtances of Bread and Wine; and that Prayers and Benedictions never deſtroy the Creatures. Moreover, if what was conſecrated were not Holy before Conſecration, as the Holy Fathers informed us in the ſame Chapter, this Conſecration could not happen unto Jeſus Chriſt, neither as God, nor as Man; not
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:47504:160"/>as God, for in this regard he is Holineſs it ſelf; not as Man, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in this Regard he was ever Holy. Beſides, if this Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion only retired the Elements of Bread and Wine from their common natural Uſe, to employ them in a religious and holy Uſe, as they have alſo declared unto us, it cannot be ſeen, that this Effect of Conſecration can ſubſiſt with the Ruin and Aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of theſe Elements: For the Uſe of any Thing, be it Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phane or Holy, doth always preſuppoſe its Truth and Exiſtency, otherwiſe it were uſeleſs in Religion and Nature. The Latin Church hath alſo laid aſide this Form of Conſecration, which ſhe attributed, ſome Ages paſt, unto theſe Words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> wiſely foreſeeing, that whilſt Conſecration was made to depend upon Prayers, and giving Thanks, the ſubſtantial Converſion would ſcarcely be believed.</p>
                  <p>I will end this Chapter by another Conſideration drawn from the Reaſons and Motives which obliged the Holy Fathers to give unto the Sacrament the Name of Sacrifice, according to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry we made in Chap. VIII. of the firſt Part, where we have at large proved by their proper Teſtimonies, that they have given it this Title by reaſon of the Bread and Wine which Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants preſented upon the Holy Table of the Church for the Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bration of the Sacrament, and by reaſon of the Oblation which was made unto God of this Bread and Wine at the inſtant of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration and afterwards. Moreover, they alſo called it ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we there render Thanks unto God for beſtowing upon us his well beloved Son; ſo that it is an Act of our Thankfulneſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Father and the Son, for the admirable and ineffable benefit of his Death; becauſe the Sacrament ſerves us now inſtead of the Legal Sacrifices, being our external Worſhip under the Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the Goſpel, as Sacrifices was that of the <hi>Jews</hi> under the Oeconomy of the Law. And in ſine, becauſe it is the Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial of the truly Propitiatory Sacrifice of the Croſs. Theſe are the Reaſons and Motives of this Name of Sacrifice, which the ancient Doctors have given to the Sacrament, and which we have largely inſiſted upon in the before-mentioned Chapter. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants hence infer two Things; firſt, That all theſe Reaſons and Motives remove from the Minds of Chriſtians the Idea of a real Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, and makes them conceive that of a Sacrifice improperly ſo called. Thence it is, that when the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Pagans</hi> reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, that they had neither Altars, nor Sacrifices, they free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confeſſed it, ſhewing thereby, that if they had given unto the Euchariſt the Name of Sacrifice, and unto the Holy Table the Name of Altar, it was but improperly, and by abuſe of Language. Thence alſo it is, that when they inſtruct thoſe within
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:47504:161"/>and that they teach them what hath ſucceeded unto the Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of the Law; they contented themſelves to oppoſe unto the Moſaical Sacrifices, either the Spiritual Sacrifices which we offer unto God under the Goſpel, or the Sacrifice of the Croſs, or both of them together; and that there ſhould reſt no Scruple in the Minds of the People which they inſtructed, touching the Nature and Quality of the Sacrifice of the Chriſtian Church, they unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly depoſe at all Times, and in all Places, that it is an Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Bread and Wine. It is alſo what they were induced to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, becauſe there was but one Altar, or one Euchariſtical Table in each Church; and that the Sacrament was celebrated but once a Day: For had they conſidered the Sacrament as a real Sacrifice, they could not have had too many Altars, nor too often offer the Sacrifice; becauſe in the often doing it, there came the greater Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and Comfort unto their Souls. It is alſo the Inſtruction which they drew from Believers, being obliged to communicate; and that thoſe were made to depart out of the Church, which did not communicate; in that they never celebrated the Euchariſt without Communicants, and that Oblations were not received, but from thoſe which were admitted unto the holy Sacrament. Why ſhould that be, if it had been a real Sacrifice, ſeeing one might have aſſiſted with Profit, although one communicated not, as is now practiſed in the Latin Church. The ſecond thing they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, is, That ſeeing they have not looked upon the Euchariſt as a Propitiatory Sacrifice for the Sins of the Quick and the Dead, they have looked upon it as a Sacrament of Communion only, and a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament which is the Memorial of Jeſus Chriſt, and of his Death, and where there is diſtributed unto the Communicants Bread and Wine for a Pledge of their Salvation: For therein is diſtributed what is there offered unto God after Conſecration. Now the Holy Fathers teſtifie, <hi>That there is offered unto God Bread and Wine, Gifts and Fruits of the Earth, the firſt Fruits of his Creatures, Food which he beſtows upon us, the ſame things which</hi> Melchizedeck <hi>offered, the Symbols and Sacraments of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Christ.</hi> So it is they have formally expreſſed themſelves in this eighth Chapter, which I deſire the Reader to peruſe over again, to ſee if theſe two Inductions are lawful and natural.</p>

                  </argument>
                  <p>BEſides what hath been hitherto ſaid, it is obſerv'd, that there be certain Occaſions wherein the Holy Fathers ſhould have omitted the Names of Figure, Antitype, Sacrament, if they had believed, that it had been the real Body of Chriſt himſelf; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs they have done the quite contrary: For inſtance; The Author of Apoſtolical Conſtitutions,
<note place="margin">Conſtit. Apoſt. l. 7. c. 26.</note> gives us a Form of Prayer and Thankſgiving for the Communion, where he makes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants ſay, <hi>We give thee Thanks, O Father, for the precious Blood of Jeſus Chriſt which was ſhed for us; and for his precious Body where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we celebrate theſe Antitypes;</hi> that is to ſay, theſe Figures; <hi>he himſelf having commanded us to ſhew forth his Death.</hi> Whereupon the Proteſtants ſay, That this Form of Thankſgiving doth not well agree with the Belief of the Latin Church, and that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in Terms too weak, if the Author which tranſmitted it to us, had believed the real Preſence, which makes the Spirit of the Communicant in the heat of his Devotion, to look unto Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and to the Subſtance of his Body; whereas this here ſpeaks unto him of Antitypes, and of Figures. So in St. <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Liturgy, the Prieſt celebrating, prayeth unto God,
<note place="margin">Liturg. Baſil.</note> 
                     <hi>in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting him,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Antitypes, or the Figures of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> For although in this Prayer he deſires of God, that he would ſanctifie and conſecrate them, nevertheleſs it doth evidently appear, that he conſiders the Symbols of Bread and Wine as already conſecrated; becauſe they could not, without the Vertue of Conſecration, be the Figures of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, which he look'd upon as already done; which, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Belief and Practice of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> was done in that very Moment.

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:47504:162"/>his Body: ſhe mingled them with the Antitypes, or the Figures of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, as much as her Hands could hold, and inſtantly, O Miracle! ſhe felt her ſelf healed, and retired.</hi> What did St. <hi>Gregory</hi> think of, will ſome ſay, in relating this Hiſtory, if he had believed what the Latin Church believes? For if that were ſo, no body but would judge, that he ought to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute this Recovery of his Siſter, not to the Sign, but to the Thing ſignified; not to the Figure, but to the Body it ſelf of Jeſus Chriſt; nevertheleſs he doth the quite contrary, 'tis to the Antitype and the Figure, that he attributes this wonderful Effect; and thereby he ſhews, that he was of another Opinion. There is in the Works of this ſame Father, an Oration, wherein doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, he diſcovered the Strength of his Wit, and the Treaſure of his Eloquence; I mean, wherein he hath omitted nothing to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his Deſire, which was, to preſerve the City of <hi>Nazianzen,</hi> whereof his Father had been Biſhop, and which the Emperors Prefect threatned with Deſtruction and Ruin.
<note place="margin">Levit.</note> This excellent Man taking Pity of this poor City, and paſſionately deſiring to preſerve it from the Storm wherewith it was threatned, he ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly beſeeches the Prefect to ſpare it: He beſeeches, he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jures, he ſets before his Eyes all that is moſt holy, and moſt ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred in Religion;

In the Life of St. <hi>Eloy</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Noyon,</hi> who lived in the VIIth Century, there is a kind of Sermon, or rather a Collection of Exhortations and Remonſtrances, which he made unto the People that he inſtructed in the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, and unto whom he preached the Doctrine of his holy
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:47504:162"/>Goſpel, and amongſt ſeveral of theſe Inſtructions, the Scope whereof was to incline them unto good, and to divert them from Evil, he directs this unto them;

Seeing then that he ſaid it not, and that he contented himſelf with ſpeaking of the Sacraments of Jeſus Chriſt: one cannot alſo reaſonably diſpenſe themſelves from inferring, that he was of another Belief; it is as the Proteſtant ſaith, what may be collected from this Teſtimony. There is in the third Tome of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils of <hi>France,</hi> which Father <hi>Sirmond</hi> hath publiſhed, a Letter of the Biſhops of the Provinces of <hi>Rheims</hi> and of <hi>Roüen,</hi> that is to ſay, of the Suffragan Biſhops of thoſe two Archbiſhopricks aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at <hi>Creſſy,</hi> Anno 858. to conſider of the Order of <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Germany,</hi> which forcibly invaded the Kingdom of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Bald,</hi> his Brother.

From all which they conclude, That the Fathers of the Council ſhould have ſpoken in much ſtronger Terms, if that inſtead of ſaying, that
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:47504:163"/>they made the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, they had ſaid, that they made the Body and Blood: They think that the Occaſion alſo required it, and that their Denial would have been better grounded; and they affirm, that if an Aſſembly of Prelates of the Latin Church were in the like Conjuncture, they would make no mention, and that juſtly of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; they would ſpeak directly of the Glorious Priviledge of making the real Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. Whence is it then, that theſe Prelates of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod of <hi>Creſſy</hi> did not do ſo; it is in all likelihood, becauſe they were not of the ſame Belief. <hi>Optatus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mileva</hi> in <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midia,</hi> aggravating the Crime of the Donatiſts, which had with horrible Impiety thrown down the Sacrament of the Orthodox unto the Dogs, ſpeaks of it after a manner which would not be eaſily pardoned, had he believed as the Latins do, that it is the very Body of Chriſt himſelf: <hi>What,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is there more ſinful and impious, than to throw the Euchariſt unto Beaſts?</hi> But what could be weaker than this Expreſſion, if this Euchariſt were the real Body of the Son of God? ought he not to have thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred after another manner againſt theſe wicked Wretches? Should he not have exaggerated with ſtronger, and more Emphatical Terms, the Horror of ſo fearful an Abomination? In a Word, ought he not have given it a blacker Term than that of Impious, and have painted the enormous Sin of theſe wicked Wretches with other Colours? Can it be thought that a Biſhop of the Latin Church ſhould be contented with ſuch a kind of Expreſſion in the like Occaſion? not at all: Wherefore then was <hi>Optatus</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent? They can conceive no other Reaſon, but the Difference of their Belief? Let the Reader judge if there be any other more probable? In the mean while I muſt tell you, that having ſometimes meditated of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s Books touching the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Prieſthood, to ſee how he advanced its Dignity, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing applied my ſelf in reading them, to endeavour to diſcover wherein he makes the greateſt Priviledge of this Order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; which with his Eloquence he exalts as much as he thought fit. I find that he only attributes unto it the Function of Prayer, to obtain by their Prayers the Grace of the Holy Spirit upon the Sacrament.

How is it that this excellent <hi>Genius</hi> had not bethought himſelf of ſaying, that though the myſtical Sacrificers of the New Teſtament did not cauſe to come down from Heaven a material Fire by their Prayers, as <hi>Elias</hi> did, to conſume the Oblations offered upon the Holy Table, but the Heavenly and Divine Fire of the Holy Ghoſt for the purifying of our Souls? They do make, moreover, the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt by the Force and Vertue of theſe Words, <hi>This is my Body.</hi> Was there ever a more proper and favourable Means and Occaſion to advance this Evangelical Dignity, and to place what it doth daily do in the Celebration of the Sacrament, by converting the Subſtance of Bread and Wine into the Subſtance of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which is infinitely more than what <hi>Elias</hi> did againſt <hi>Baals</hi> falſe Prophets? Every Body knows in what manner the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Catholick Doctors do exalt this Dignity, and that they never forget when they treat of its Advantages and Priviledges, to attribute unto their Prieſts the Priviledge of making the real Body of the Son of God. And I don't wonder any Body ſhould think ſtrange of it, if they conſider the Doctrine and Belief of the Latin Church; how is it poſſible then that the great St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> ſhould have forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten it, that he hath not ſaid a Word of it, and that in ſo preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Occaſion he paſſed over in ſilence a Circumſtance ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable and eſſential to his Subject.

                     <hi>Let them forbear then to offer Milk at the Sacrifice, becauſe the manifeſt and clear Example of the Truth of the Goſpel appears plainly to our Eyes, which admits not of offering any thing but Bread and Wine.</hi> The Proteſtants think, that the Cenſure of the Council had been better applied, if it had been repreſented unto thoſe which dared to offer Milk inſtead of Wine, that it was not Milk, but Wine which was to be converted into the proper Subſtance of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; and that it is very likely, that if the Fathers had believed this ſubſtantial Converſion, they would not have failed to have done ſo, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Occaſion invited them thereunto. The XVIth Council of <hi>Toledo</hi> aſſembled the Year of our Lord 693. do cenſure ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Abuſe, which is, That ſome Prieſts bethought themſelves of offering for the Communion little Cruſts of Bread, which they raiſed round from Loaves, intended for their own uſe, inſtead of offering of whole Loaves: The Council-reproves this Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, whereunto it oppoſeth the Example of Jeſus Chriſt, who took an intire Loaf; but it ſaid not unto thoſe People, that they were to blame, ſlightly to offer bits of Bread without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the Bread of the Euchariſt is changed into the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:47504:164"/>of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which nevertheleſs might have been of great weight unto them. On the contrary, it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands to offer midling Loaves, fearing, if they were too big, the over-plus which remained after the Communion, might by its Groſsneſs and Quantity, incommode the Stomach of them which eat it; which, as 'tis ſuppoſed, drew them quite from any Thought of Reality, and conducted them unto the Conſideration of the Sacrament. In fine, when <hi>Ratherius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Verona</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibits at the End of the Xth Century, committing the Euchariſt unto Lay-perſons to be carried unto ſick Folks, he doth not ſhew in cenſuring this Abuſe, that there is any Crime in putting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to prophane Hands the real Body of our Saviour, there being none but the Perſons which he hath conſecrated unto his own Service, which ought to enjoy this Priviledge, which in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability he would not have failed to do, had he been thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſwaded of the Truth of the real Preſence; he only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands,

                     <hi>That none preſume to give the Euchariſt unto any Lay-man or Woman to be carried unto the Sick.</hi> But 'tis not yet time to end theſe Proofs, the Inſtructions which the Holy Fathers gave their <hi>Neophytes,</hi> and new Baptiſed, will very likely afford us others: For although they never ſpake againſt their Judgment, not even in their Homilies and popular Sermons, where, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Circumſtance of the Times, they uſed ſome Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtriction of not giving the Euchariſt the Name of Bread and Wine, thinking there might be preſent ſome Catechumeny and Perſons not initiated, which might hear them, and in whom the Names of Bread and Wine might have created too low and mean Thoughts of the Excellency of our Myſteries: Nevertheleſs, becauſe it is ſuppoſed, that they have expreſſed themſelves clearer in inſtructing theſe young Plants but newly grafted into the my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Stock of the Church, by holy Baptiſm; let us ſee what Succour we can draw from theſe ſorts of Catechiſms, wherein to give their <hi>Neophytes</hi> a great <hi>Idea</hi> of the Sacrament, they forbear not uſing ſtrong and elevated Expreſſions; but yet in ſuch a manner, as they plainly diſcover in what Way they are to be underſtood: For inſtance;

                     <hi>the Myſtery of Bread and Wine;</hi> and that he ſaith, <hi>That the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt is expreſſed or ſhewn by the</hi> Species <hi>of Wine; that all Wine that is offered in Figure of his Death, is his Blood; and that in the Bread is received the Figure of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ib p. 14. Ibid.

                     <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 15.</note> So that when he told them afterwards, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt paſſeth into it,</hi> that is to ſay, the Bread and Wine; they eaſily conceive, that it is in regard of his Efficacy and Vertue wherewith he accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies the lawful Uſe of his Sacrament; or as he ſaith himſelf, <hi>by the Fire of his Divine Spirit.</hi> And when he bids them,

<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> I mean unto the Quality wherewith the Sacrament is accompanied for the Conſolation of our Souls. <hi>Do not boil</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Sacrament in the Veſſel of a carnal Heart, which is natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubject unto its Paſſions;

                     <q>It is truly (ſaith he) this Heredi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Preſent of the New Teſtament, which he hath left unto you as a Pledg of his Preſence, in the Night wherein he was betrayed to be crucified; it is that <hi>Viaticum</hi> of our Journey whereby we are nouriſhed by the Way until we go unto him in departing this World; for he would that his Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits ſhould remain with us, he would have our Souls to be always ſanctified in his precious Blood by the Image of his Paſſion: therefore he commanded his faithful Diſciples, which whom he eſtabliſhed the firſt Miniſters of his Church, conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continually to practiſe theſe Myſteries of eternal Life, which it is neceſſary all Prieſts ſhould celebrate in all Churches throughout the World, until Jeſus Chriſt comes again from Heaven to the end that the Prieſts themſelves, and all the faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful People ſhould always have before their Eyes the Protraiture of the Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt, and that carrying him in their Hands, and receiving him with the Mouth and the Heart, we may have deeply engraven in our Memory the Grace of our Redemption; and that we ſhould poſſeſs againſt the Poiſon of Devils the ſweet Antidote of a continual Preſervative.</q> Theſe Words are ſweet, and full of Light, as well as of Piety; but here are others of the ſame Catechiſm, which made no leſs Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the Minds of the new Converts, and which no leſs aſſiſted them in underſtanding of this Myſtery; <q>In that he commanded (ſaith he) to offer the Sacraments of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood in the <hi>Species</hi> of Bread and Wine,
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 16.</note> it is for a two-fold Reaſon; in the firſt place, to the end the Lamb of God without Spot might give unto the faithful People to be celebrated, a pure Sacrifice without Fire, or Blood, or Boiling the Fleſh; and that all the World might offer eaſily and ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: then as it is neceſſary Bread ſhould be made of ſeveral Grains of Wheat reduced into Flour by the help of Water, and that it be baked by Fire, there ſhould reaſonably be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in it the Figure of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, who we know made one ſole Body of the Multitude of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</q> Unto theſe two Catechiſts I will add a third, which was incomparably more famous;
<note place="margin">Auguſt. Serm. ad Infant. ap. Fulg. de Bapt. Aethiop.</note> it is the great St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who gave this Leſſon unto his <hi>Neophytes:</hi> 
                     <q>What you ſee is Bread, and it is alſo what your Eyes do teſtifie; but the Inſtruction which your Faith deſires, is, That the Bread is the Body of Jeſus
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:47504:167"/>Chriſt, and the Cup his Blood. This is ſaid in a few Words, and it may be theſe few may ſuffice for your Faith; but Faith requires to be inſtructed; for the Prophet ſaith, <hi>If you believe not, you cannot understand;</hi> then you may now ſay unto me, ſeeing you have commanded us to believe, explain unto us what it is, to the end we might underſtand; for this Thought may be in every body's Mind: We know of whom Jeſus Chriſt our Lord took Fleſh, to wit, of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> we know he was nurſed in his Infancy, that he was fed, that he grew, that he attained the Age of Manhood, that he ſuffered Perſecution of the <hi>Jews,</hi> that he was nailed to the Croſs, that he there died, and was buried; that he roſe the third Day, that he aſcended into Heaven when he was pleaſed to go thither; that he lifted up his Body from whence he ſhall come to judg the quick and the dead; and that he is now ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on the right Hand of the Father: How then is the Bread his Body, and the Cup his Blood? Brethren, theſe things are called Sacraments, becauſe one thing is what we ſee, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother is that we underſtand; that which is ſeen is a bodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Species;</hi> that which we underſtand hath a ſpiritual Fruit: If then you would know what the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is, hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to St. <hi>Paul</hi> the Apoſtle, which ſaid unto Believers, You are the Body of Jeſus Chriſt and his Members, your Sacrament is laid upon the Lord's Table, and you there receive your Myſtery. You ſay Amen unto what you are, and you there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſubſcribe by your Anſwer. It is ſaid unto you, <hi>The Body of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and you anſwer, <hi>Amen;</hi> be Members then of Jeſus Chriſt, that your <hi>Amen</hi> may be true. But why all this to the Bread? let us not add here nothing of our own, but let us farther hear the ſame Apoſtle ſpeaking of this Sacrament; <hi>We which are many, are one Bread and one Body;</hi> underſtand this and rejoice; for here is nothing but Unity, Piety, Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, one Bread and one Body, although we be many. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that the Bread is not made of one Grain, but of many: When you were exorciſed, you paſſed, as it were, under the Mill; when you were baptiſed, you were, as it were, kneaded; and when you received the fire of the Holy Ghoſt, you were baked like Bread: Be then what you ſee, and receive what you are. See here what the Apoſtle hath ſaid of Bread, whereby he ſufficiently ſhews, without repeating it, what we ſhould believe in regard of the Cup; for as to make this viſible <hi>Species</hi> of Bread, ſeveral Grains are reduced into one Body to repreſent what the Scripture ſaith of Believers, they were but one Heart, and one Soul in God: It is alſo
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:47504:168"/>the ſame of Wine; conſider how it is one, ſeveral Grapes are in a Bunch, but their Liquor is mingled all into one Body; ſo it is Chriſt hath repreſented us, ſo it is he hath made us his, and that he hath conſecrated upon the holy Table the Myſtery of Unity, and of our Peace.</q> So it was they inſtructed in the ancient Church the new Baptiſed; they were told, that what they ſee upon the Holy Table, was Bread; and their own Eyes were called to witneſs this Truth. They were taught, that this Bread was the natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as it was his myſtical and moral Body, that is to ſay, his Church; becauſe it is the Sacrament both of the one and the other; and that in the Sacrament muſt carefully be diſtinguiſhed the Subſtance of the Symbols which are viſible and corporeal, from the Benefit which accrues unto the believing Soul, and which is a Thing inviſible and ſpiritual; that faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Believers are, although for myſtical Reaſons, the very ſame thing which they ſee upon the myſtical Table, that is to ſay, Bread; according to what the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>we are one Bread;</hi> and that they do receive truly that which they ſee myſtically. Now let the Reader judg, if theſe Catechiſms, and theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions are for the Uſe of <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, or for the Uſe of Proteſtants; as for my particular, I'le paſs unto a new Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>Proofs of the Doctrines of the Holy Fathers, drawn by <hi>Proteſtants</hi> from ſome Cuſtoms of the Ancient Church.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THere are two ſorts of Language uſed in the Society and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of Men, to communicate unto each other their Thoughts and Intentions, I mean Words and Actions. The Language of Actions is ſilent indeed, yet nevertheleſs very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible; becauſe Actions, I ſpeak of thoſe authorized by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Uſe, are for the moſt part as ſignificant as Words: It is not then to be thought ſtrange, if we do relate what Inferences the Proteſtants draw from certain Cuſtoms which were practiſed by the ancient Church, and which we have at large eſtabliſhed in the firſt Part: Therefore we will look upon them in this, as eſtabliſhed, and will content our ſelves in barely mentioning them one after another, to infer from each of them what may lawfully be deduced. In <hi>Africa</hi> in St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s time, they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated after Meat, Thurſday before <hi>Eaſter;</hi> and in ſeveral Churches in <hi>Egypt,</hi> every <hi>Saturday</hi> in the Year at Evening, after having made a good Meal: Without ſpeaking of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, where ſome think the ſame was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctis'd, what Belief could thoſe People have of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt? It is no very eaſie matter to think, that they believed it to be the Subſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Fleſh it ſelf, elſe it muſt be confeſſed, that they were guilty of an horrible Profanation to lodg in a Stomach full of Meats, and it may be ſometimes even to exceſs, the precious Body of the Saviour of Mankind, the only Object of their Worſhip and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doration. Nevertheleſs, none of the ancient Writers have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned this Practice; thoſe which have treated of it, have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as of an innocent Cuſtom, which had no hurt in it, and which, moreover, was authorized by the Example of Jeſus Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Therefore when the third Council of <hi>Carthage</hi> commanded to celebrate the Sacrament faſting, it excepted the <hi>Thurſday</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Eaſter,</hi> whereon it permitted to participate every Year after the Meal. An evident Proof, ſay ſome, that there was no Crime in this Cuſtom, whereas it would have been intolerable, if they had believed then the ſame of the Sacrament, as the Latin Church
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:47504:169"/>now doth belive of it: Therefore no Body can juſtly blame the Severity of its Laws, when it is ſo ſtrictly prohibited to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate otherwiſe than Faſting. The ancient Church for a long time uſed Patens and Chalices of Glaſs; and we do not find, that theſe firſt Chriſtians ever made any difficulty of put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Sacrament in Glaſs-Chalices, nor that they were ever blamed that did it. On the contrary, ſome of thoſe which uſed this Practice were commended for it; nevertheleſs we cannot ſay, that theſe ancient Believers were leſs circumſpect than we are, in the Celebration of the Sacrament: Wherefore then was it, that they feared not ſo much ſpilling of it in that Occaſion, as the Latin Church hath done ſome Ages paſt? Let this Difference be well conſidered, for, ſaith the Proteſtant, I am much deceived, if upon a ſerious and impartial Debate, it will not be attributed unto the Difference of Judgment, it not being to be imagin'd, that Chriſtians ſo good, and zealous, and fervent for the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, as thoſe were of whom we ſpeak, and have had the ſame Belief of the Sacrament that the Latin Church at this time hath, which for ſome time paſt, doth not ſuffer the Uſe of Glaſs-Chalices, that they had not, at leaſt, uſed ſo much Precaution as ſhe doth, to conſecrate and diſtribute the Sacrament; I mean they would have made it a Scruple of Conſcience of putting the Body of their God and Saviour in ſo brittle a Thing as Glaſs, thoſe which were ſo careful, that none of the ſacred Symbols of their Bread and Wine ſhould fall to the Ground. The ancient Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians gave the Euchariſt to young ſucking Children at the Breaſt; a Cuſtom which continued in the Weſt until the XIIth Century, and which is ſtill practiſed in moſt Chriſtian Communions, excepting the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks, and the <hi>Proteſtants.</hi> How came it to paſs this Abuſe was ſo long tolerated in the Church, if it had been always believed therein, what the Latins do believe at preſent, who cannot juſtly be blamed, by little and little, to have aboliſhed this Cuſtom? One could not without Horror, ſee expoſed what was believed to be the Body and Blood of Chriſt, unto the unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and ſad Accidents, which oftentimes of neceſſity happen in communicating of young Children; thoſe little Creatures being uncapable, by reaſon of their tender Age, of receiving the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament with Reſpect which is due unto the Body it ſelf of Jeſus Chriſt our Redeemer. But wherefore did the ancient Church for ſo many Ages ſuffer ſuch an Abuſe, or at leaſt, having tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated it ſome time, wherefore had ſhe not bethought her ſelf of aboliſhing it, inſtead of letting it take root in the midſt of it? Was it not ſo wiſe as the Church at this time is? Had ſhe leſs Zeal, leſs Piety, and leſs Prudence? had ſhe leſs love for Jeſus
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:47504:169"/>Chriſt, or leſs Veneration for his ſacred Perſon? certainly I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe not. This Difference then of Conduct cannot be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon any other Reaſon, but upon the Difference of Faith: whilſt Chriſtians believed that what they received in the Euchariſt, was Bread and Wine in Subſtance, but that at the ſame time they were alſo the Divine Sacraments of the Body and Blood of Chriſt; the Reaſons which moved them to give the Euchariſt unto young Children, made them paſs by the Indecencies which might be feared on the Behalf of theſe little Creatures. But when the Doctrine changed in the Weſt, and that in the Latin Church they began to ſay, that it was the very Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, this ancient Cuſtom was aboliſhed, it not agreeing well with their Belief: And indeed we ſee this Abolition was made about the time when this notable Change happened in their Doctrine. And becauſe that in other Chriſtian Communions, there is no Altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion happened by any publick Decree in the Tradition of their Fathers upon the Subject of the Sacrament, they have innocently retained the ancient Cuſtom of giving the Sacrament unto little Children. I confeſs this Practiſe is contrary to what St. <hi>Paul</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of Communicants, which is to examine themſelves before they draw near unto the holy Table; of which Proof little Children are uncapable. But as we do not here treat, but only of what was done by the ancient Chriſtians, and of what is ſtill practiſed by ſeveral Chriſtian Churches, and not of what ought to be done, I'le ſay no more of it; referring the Induction which the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants draw from this Practiſe, unto the Judgment of all reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Perſons, which will take the Pains to read this Hiſtory. The Communion under both Kinds was practis'd in the Church until theſe laſt Ages, wherein the Latins deprived the People of the Uſe of the ſacred Cup; for as for all other Chriſtian Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which hold not Correſpondence with her, they retain the Cuſtom of adminiſtring the Sacrament under both Symbols, altho with ſome little Difference. The great Ground of the Latin Church for ſo doing, being through Fear of ſhedding it: But how comes it to paſs, that this Fear is ſo lately crept into their Thoughts? Whence is it, that ſhe her ſelf practis'd the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion under both Kinds, for above a thouſand Years without any body ſcrupling it? On the contrary, when ſhe began to forbid the Uſe of the Cup unto the People by a Decree at the beginning of the XVth Century, a great many Perſons complained of it, and whole Countries earneſtly deſired, it might be reſtored unto them. Wherefore did ſhe ſo long time grant unto her People the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion under both Symbols diſtinctly? Was there then leſs cauſe of Fear of ſhedding, than when they deprived them of this Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,
<pb n="294" facs="tcp:47504:170"/>particularly at the time when in <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf they uſed Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lices of Glaſs? For it muſt be owned, that Glaſs being a weak thing, there was never greater ground to fear ſpilling, than during the time thoſe Chalices were uſed; yet nevertheleſs when there was moſt cauſe of this Fear, they ſuffered the People to partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pate of the Cup of our Lord, as well as of his Bread; and when there is leſs Danger, Glaſs-Chalices being no longer in Uſe, they are refuſed it. Whence, ſay they, proceeds ſuch a notable Change, which could have no ſhew of Reaſon, if the Doctrine had not been altered? but becauſe wiſe and prudent Perſons do not incline unto theſe Sorts of Changes, without ſome powerful Motives, it muſt be freely confeſſed, that no other can be found, whatever Scrutiny could be made, but the Change of Belief. And in truth, ſay they again, if this Change be not preſuppoſed, it will be a very hard matter to forbear cenſuring thoſe of Lightneſs, which made it a Change; I ſay, of the Nature, that is, of, and in a thing which was grounded upon the Authority of Chriſt himſelf, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Practice of ſo many Ages. Whereas if the prohibiting the Cup be conſidered as a Conſequence of this Change, it will not be hard to conceive, that the Fear of ſhedding the real Blood of the Son of God, obliged them to forbid unto the People the Uſe of the holy Cup, rather chuſing to deprive them of this Comfort and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, than to fall into the Inconvenience of ſome negligent ſpil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Subſtance it ſelf of the Blood of their Divine Saviour. A Fear which hath not ſeiſed the other Chriſtian Communions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have not practis'd any Innovation in this particular; or that at leaſt there hath not any been made by any publick Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In the ancient Church the Euchariſt was delivered into the Communicants Hand, who with the Hand put it into their Mouth, as hath been proved; and we may produce Examples of this Practice in the XIIth Century, in <hi>Flanders:</hi> At this time in the Latin Church it is put directly into the Communicants Mouth, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to whom it is not permitted to receive it with the Hand, although the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> her ſelf practiſed it ſo formerly for ſeveral Ages. From whence again could proceed this Change, but from the Change of Doctrine? whilſt it was believed, that what was received at the myſtical Table, was true Bread and Wine; but Bread and Wine which the Conſecration had ſeparated from the common Uſe they had in Nature, to apply them unto a holy and religious Uſe in Grace, Communicants were permitted to receive the Sacrament in their Hands. But when they taught, that it was the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, they began to put it into the Mouth of ſuch as preſented themſelves at the Communion, judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their Hands were not worthy to receive the Fleſh it ſelf of
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:47504:170"/>their Saviour; and fearing that ſome, by Neglect, ſhould let fall to the Ground this pretious Body; an Inconvenience which their Forefathers never thought of, or if they did think of it, they did not ſo much fear it, though otherwiſe they were as circumſpect in the Celebration of this Divine Sacrament, ſo far as to take Care with incomparable Exactneſs, that none of it ſhould fall to the Ground. Let every body judge the Reaſon of ſo notable a Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference. But if the Sacrament was put into the Hand of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants, they were wont alſo for a long time to carry it home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with them to their Houſes: At preſent amongſt the Latins, it would be a criminal Action, Father <hi>Petau</hi> tells us, and held for a Prophanation of this Sacrament. As for my part, I cannot blame this Severity of the Latin Church, becauſe ſhe believes that it is the adorable Body of the Son of God, whereunto is owing Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign Reſpect. What ſhall we then ſay unto the ancient Fathers which permitted it, and which believed not, as St. <hi>Baſil</hi> tells us, that this Cuſtom was not worthy of Blame? We cannot but know that their Zeal was greater than ours, and their Piety more ardent than what appears in us at this time. How then have they ſo long time tolerated this Practice in the Church, and even in that of <hi>Rome,</hi> as St. <hi>Jerom</hi> hath made appear? From whence the Proteſtant concludes, That one cannot reaſonably forbear attributing the Reaſon of this Toleration to any thing, but the Difference of their Doctrine, and to ſay, that their Belief upon this Point being quite contrary, they made no Scruple of ſuffering what the Latins would not ſuffer at preſent for all the World. And as they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered Communicants to carry the Sacrament to their Houſes to keep and take it when they pleaſed, they alſo ſuffered them to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it in their Travels and Journeys, even by Sea, where they made no Difficulty of celebrating and participating of it when Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion required; as the Example of <hi>Maximinian</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Syracuſa,</hi> and his Companions do teſtifie, for being in Danger of ſuffering Shipwrack, they received (it is ſaid) the Body and Blood of their Redeemer: But in the Latin Church it is practiſed quite contrary at this time, it not being permitted to celebrate the whole Maſs, neither at the Sea, nor upon Rivers, but only to read the Epiſtle and Goſpel, to ſay the Lords Prayer, and give the Benediction: In a Word, to ſay that which was anciently called the Maſs of the Catechumeny, that is to ſay, unto that Part called the Canon.

<pb n="296" facs="tcp:47504:171"/>is motion, as at Sea, and upon Rivers; in which places it is believed that an intire Maſs cannot be ſaid.</hi> Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, blamed not what was done by <hi>Maximinian</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, when he relates the Hiſtory of it in his Dialogues, no more than St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doth the Action of his Brother <hi>Satyrus:</hi> All which again gives Ground to believe that in all likelihood, they had not then that Opinion of the Sacrament, which <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> now have; for they would not have failed to have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the ſame Caution. Anciently in the Church the Communion was freely ſent unto ſick Folks by Lay-perſons, by Boys, Men, or Women, which continued in the Weſt until the IXth, and Xth Centuries. What Appearance is there they would ſo long have tolerated this Cuſtem, if the Belief of thoſe times had been the ſame of that of the Latin Church at preſent? it is thought they would have been more reſerved; and that they would not have ſo ſlightly entruſted the Body of Jeſus Chriſt unto all Sorts of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, indifferently. But beſides all theſe Cuſtoms which we have inſtanced, and from whence we have drawn the neceſſary Inferences, there be yet others which we already examined in the firſt Part, the Conſequences whereof we are alſo obliged to ſhew. The ancient Chriſtians made no Difficulty to imploy the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to make Plaiſters, as St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> hath aſſured us: every body knows, that to make a Plaiſter, ſometimes Drugs are uſed that muſt be bruiſed and pounded in a Mortar; ſometimes Roots are uſed that muſt be boiled; and which by means of certain Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, are reduced into the conſiſtence of an Oyntment, or thick matter, and ſuch as may conveniently be ſpread upon a Linen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth, or upon Flax, afterwards to apply it unto the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per'd part which wants Eaſe. Was there ever any Chriſtian that believed ſuch a Sort of Medicine could be made of the proper and natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt? that it could be beat and pounded in a Mortar, or boiled with Liquor? or, in a Word, reduced in the State, which they are wont to do thoſe Things which are requiſite to make Plaiſters? or if any were ſo extravagant to believe it, or ſo wicked and ſenſeleſs to attempt it, had it been poſſible to be done? all others would they not have exclaimed againſt ſuch a Perſon? would they not have eſteemed him mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrous, and worthy enduring the greateſt of all Puniſhments? Nevertheleſs, there hath been found thoſe which made Plaiſters of the Euchariſt, and which, far from being blamed, have been praiſed and commended by pious and devout Perſons fearing God, witneſs that Mother mentioned by St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Seeing then that a Plaiſter cannot be made of the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt, it neceſſarily follows, that where there was one made, it was of
<pb n="297" facs="tcp:47504:171"/>the Subſtance of the Symbols; and that the Chriſtians that did ſo, were perſwaded, that it was not the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, but a Subſtance of Bread and Wine. In the ancient Church the Sacrament was buried with the Dead: as there is no Chriſtian but knows that Chriſt died, that he was buried, and roſe again the third Day; neither is there any but do know that he dieth no more, and that he ſhall no more be buried. Thoſe then which heretofore buried the Euchariſt with the Dead, did not believe in all likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood that it was the very Body of our Lord; for they would not have done any ſuch thing, the very Thoughts of it would have terrified them, and they would have eſteemed themſelves the worſt of Men to have put their Saviour, which they knew to be in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, in the Poſſeſſion of Soveraign Glory, into ſuch a mean and low Eſtate. In this ſame Church in ſeveral Places they cauſed to be burnt the Overplus of the Sacrament; and in other Places they cauſed it to be eaten by Children, which they made come from School on purpoſe: Is it to be thought, that if they had believed it was the very Subſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that they would have given it ſo freely unto Children, who were ſent for to come from School to that effect? It is alſo more unlikely, that they would have cauſed to be burnt the Fleſh it ſelf of the Saviour of Mankind, and to caſt the Son of God into the Fire, who had ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed them from the eternal Fire of Hell. The ancient Chriſtians have ſometimes taken the conſecrated Cup, and have mingled it with Ink, and then dipt their Pen in theſe two Liquors mixed, the more authentically to ſign what they had intended to ratifie, not conſidering what is in the Cup, but as a Symbol and Sacrament of the Blood of the Son of God; yet one would be ſtruck with ſome Terror ſo to ſee profaned this Sacrament of our Salvation; but if one conſiders it as the Blood it ſelf of Jeſus Chriſt, one ſhall find himſelf ſeized with a holy Fear: And becauſe it cannot fall within the Compaſs of a Chriſtian's Thoughts, to employ unto this Uſe the Subſtance of the Blood of our Lord, if he had it in his power it ſelf, it muſt be concluded, that thoſe who did it, were very far from thinking that it was the real Blood of our Saviour. It may be, the ſame Conſequence might be drawn from the Practice of the <hi>Greek</hi> Church, which mingles warm Water with the Wine after Conſecration, and at the inſtant of communicating. But becauſe we ſhall be obliged to ſpeak elſewhere of the Belief of the <hi>Greeks,</hi> we will not enlarge upon it in this place, and we ſhall only advertiſe the Reader, that all the Cuſtoms from whence have been drawn theſe Inductions contained in this Chapter, have been examined in the 5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 Chapters of the firſt Part of this

I will not here inſiſt upon the Treatiſe of <hi>Joſeph Albon,</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh Jew,</hi> called <hi>Ikkarim,</hi> wherein he repreſents all the Inconveniencies which ariſe from the Doctrine of the ſubſtantial Converſion; and which, as he conceiveth, doth contradict the Lights of Reaſon, and the Teſtimony of the Senſes; but I will only ſay, that the Proteſtants draw this Conſequence, That if the ancient Chriſtians had been of that Belief, the <hi>Jews</hi> and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> would not have failed in all likelihood to have reproached them of it, and to have made it the Subject of their Scorn; for they cannot think that <hi>Celſus</hi> had leſs Wit than <hi>Averroes,</hi> nor that the ancient Enemies of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity were leſs inquiſitive, nor leſs concerned than the <hi>Turks</hi> are now, who commonly live in Ignorance. The <hi>Roman</hi> Empire was never more refined by Arts and Sciences, than when the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion began to be eſtabliſhed; ſo that Chriſtians had for their Enemies and Perſecutors Men full of Wit, Knowledg, and of Underſtanding, and which had ſpent a great part of their time in Search of Learning: nevertheleſs we do not find that they have conteſted with them upon the Subject of the Euchariſt, nor that ever they made them the Reproaches that <hi>Averroes</hi> and the <hi>Turks</hi> have made, and do ſtill make unto thoſe of the Latin Church. It is the Obſervation which the late Mr. <hi>Rigaut</hi> made,
<note place="margin">Rigalt. not. ad Tertul. l. 2. ad Uxor. c. 5.</note> when he ſaid, <hi>That amongst ſo many Villanies and Injuries wherewith they charged the Chriſtians, even in accuſing them of Impiety, under pretext they had no Altars, and that they ſacrificed not. And amongst ſo many Apoſtates which fell away from their Religion, there was not one found that accuſed them of eating the Fleſh, and drinking the Blood of their God.</hi> And to ſay the Truth, ſay the Proteſtants, there is great Reaſon to wonder at this Silence, if it be ſuppoſed that the ancient Chriſtians believed and did what is done and believed by the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Church in the point of the Sacrament. We know that the

                     <hi>Do you think there is any Man ſuch a Fool as to believe that what he eats is God?</hi> They can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not then conceive, that thoſe People were of ſuch Thoughts, and that they ſhould have been ſilent towards Chriſtians, if they had indeed believed, that they did eat the Fleſh it ſelf of their God and Saviour; What likelihood is there they would have ſpared them upon it, after having flouted them with moſt of their Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and after having made them the Subject of their Raileries and Paſtimes? Certainly when they compare this conſtant and continued Silence, with the Reproach made againſt the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins, they can ſee no other Cauſe of this different Proceeding, but the Difference of Belief. For if the primitive Chriſtians had believed with the Latin Church, that what they receive at the Lord's Table, was truly and really their God, the <hi>Gentiles</hi> would not have failed to have made them the ſame Reproaches which the Infidels make againſt the Latins.

To this Effect it is ſaid, That it might well be, that the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> tranſported with Hatred and Malice againſt the Chriſtians, might have given a wrong mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto what they had extorted by Torments from the Mouth of ſome of their Domeſticks; and that having heard of them, that their Maſters called the Bread and Wine of the Holy Communion, the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, they concluded, that it was indeed his Body and Blood, and that they did really eat this Fleſh and Blood: But as it was not juſt to judg of the Belief of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians upon the Teſtimony of their Enemies, whoſe aim was only to ſlander the Truth of their Religion, let us conſider a little, ſay they, what is contained in the Words of <hi>Oecumenius,</hi> or if you will, of St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> ſpeaking by the Mouth of <hi>Oecumenius:</hi> In the firſt place, they attribute unto the Ignorance and Stupidity of theſe Slaves, that they thought that the Chriſtians held the Sacrament of the Euchariſt for the true Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they called it his Body and Blood; having heard their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſay, that the Divine Communion is the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>They thought that it was really the Fleſh and Blood, and ſaid ſo unto thoſe which examined them.</hi> Secondly, they declare poſitively, That the <hi>Pagans</hi> had taken it, as if the Chriſtians had eaten really this Fleſh and Blood, which ſheweth that the Chriſtians had quite another Opinion:

It ſhall ſuffice to obſerve here, that when the Holy Fathers anſwered unto this ſhameful Reproach, or rather this black and deviliſh Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumny, it was by a down-right Denial, and to ſhew it was a Thing ſo horrible and ſo far diſtant from their holy Diſcipline, that the very Thoughts of it diſpleaſed them, without ever making any Exception of the Euchariſt. <hi>The falſe Devils,</hi>

But when on the other Hand, I conſider their Candor and Sincerity, their Piety, Zeal, and the great Inclinations they had to glorifie God by their Death, and the little Account they made of their Lives, I dare not accuſe them of Prevarication, nor of Hypocriſie; I too much honour their Memory, and have too great a Love for their Vertue: God forbid, ſaith he, that I ſhould ever do them ſo great Injury, or have any evil Thoughts of them, becauſe I own their Proceedings to be ſincere, and always accompanied with Truth: as for my particular, I leave it unto indifferent Perſons to judge of the Conſequence that hath been made of their Conduct.

As to the former of theſe two Heads, we ſee in the ſecond Chapter of the firſt part, that the Heretick <hi>Marc,</hi> pretended to conſecrate Challices wherein there was Wine, and even White Wine as ſome think, and that inſiſting very long upon the Words of Invocation and Prayer, he made it appear red and of a Purple Colour, to the end it ſhould be believed that the Divinity which he called Grace, ſhould from the higheſt Heavens diſtil his Blood into the Cup, by means of his Invocation; whereupon it is ſaid, that if the Catholicks of his time had believed that the Wine of the Sacred Cup was changed by the vertue of Conſecration, into the real ſubſtance of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the impoſture of this Deceiver would not have been ſo
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:47504:177"/>much regarded by thoſe miſerable Wretches which he ſeduced, for they might have ſaid unto him, that he took a great deal of pains to little purpoſe, in making the Blood of the God which he preached, come into the Cup; ſeeing that the Catholicks and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox without any Magick or Enchantment, did what he preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to do by the help of his Sorceries, in caſting a Miſt before the Eyes of thoſe that were preſent; and that by pronouncing of theſe Words, <hi>This is my Body, This is my Blood,</hi> they change the Wine of the Cup into the very Blood of the God which they adore: Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, St. <hi>Irencus,</hi> nor St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> which have narrowly enough examined the Hereſy of this Deceiver, and all that he did in the celebration of the Myſteries, nor any one elſe that I hear of, have not made him this Objection, to expoſe unto the ſight of the whole World, the folly of his enterpriſe; which ſhews, as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants ſay, that the Orthodox Chriſtians did not then believe, that what was in the conſecrated Cup was the real Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. In the ſame Chapter of the firſt part, we mentioned the <hi>Aſcodrutes</hi> or <hi>Aſcodrupites,</hi> which rejected both Baptiſm and the Euchariſt, ſaying, <hi>That inviſible things ſhould not be repreſented by vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible things, nor incorporeal things, by ſenſible and corporal, and that Images and Figures ought not to be made upon Earth.</hi> How could the Holy Fathers grapple with theſe Hereticks, or condemn as a Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy that which they taught, that the Symbols of Spiritual and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Things ought not to be ſenſible nor corporal, if Catholicks had not in their Sacraments Symbols of this Nature: For it would have been unjuſt to condemn that for a Hereſy in others, which we believe and approve our ſelves; or how ſhould theſe Hereticks have abſtained from the celebration of Baptiſm and the Euchariſt, if the Orthodox had believed with them, that there was nothing ſenſible nor corporal in the one nor the other of theſe two Sacraments; for what made them lay aſide theſe Sacraments, was the ſubſtance of the Symbols which were corporal and viſible; and as the ſame reaſon which made them deny Baptiſm, made them alſo reject the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Sacrament, this was the reaſon that they did not find the Bread and Wine of this Sacrament, no leſs viſible and corporal than the Water of the other; ſo that the Holy Fathers oppoſing their Hereſy refute it alike, both for the one and the other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and in diſputing againſt it, they own that the ſubſtance of the Symbols are ſenſible and viſible in both; for in this reſpect they make no diſtinction betwixt Baptiſm and the Euchariſt; this is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the Proteſtant. As touching the ſilence of Hereticks, it is almoſt of the ſame force with that of the Gentiles; becauſe the ſame Truths which were the Object of the Scorn and Contempt of Pagans, were alſo the ſubject of the ſlander and contradiction of Hereticks,
<pb n="310" facs="tcp:47504:178"/>ſome whereof denied the truth of the Human Nature of Jeſus Chriſt, as <hi>Marcion,</hi> and ſeveral others, which attributed unto him an ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Body, a Shadow and Figure of a Body, teaching that the Son of God did not become Man, and that he manifeſted himſelf unto Man only in a falſe ſhape, not having a true Body, but one in ſhew: Others have denied his Divinity, as <hi>Ebion, Cerinthus, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temon,</hi> and others, which maintained that our Jeſus was not God, but Man only, and that he did not begin to be, but when he was born of the Holy Virgin; two Myſteries which we have ſeen, whereof the Jews and Pagans both made light: The Croſs of Chriſt which was the ſtumbling block of the Jews, and the ſcorn of the Heathen, was alſo contradicted by Hereticks, who were not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to ſay that Jeſus Chriſt had not truly ſuffered, but that he ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther put another Man in his ſtead, or avoided the fury of thoſe which crucified him, by this ſeeming Body wherewith they ſay he was inveſted.* The Reſurrection of the Body which was eſteemed a Story and Fable by the Gentiles, alſo offended exceedingly ſome Hereticks, as the <hi>Gnoſticks,</hi> the <hi>Marcionites,</hi> and ſome others: And to ſpeak in a Word, there was ſcarce any one Article of our Faith, which in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, was not traverſed by ſome Hereſy, or that met not with ſome contradiction amongſt Chriſtians themſelves. What likelihood then, ſay they, is there, that if the Doctrine of the ſubſtantial Converſion, and all the Conſequences which neceſſarily depend of it, had been taught by Chriſtians, and received into the Articles of their Faith, but it would have recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſome attempt by Hereticks, who not having diſowned the uſe of their Senſes nor of their Reaſon, could not chooſe, as they think, but have diſputed againſt them, eſpecially when they ſhould have conſidered, that they would have denied the teſtimony of their Senſes, and the cleareſt light of their Reaſon: Nevertheleſs, we cannot find in any Monument of the ancient Doctors of the Church, that the Hereticks ever conteſted with the Catholicks and Ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox upon the point of the Euchariſt; it is indeed true that ſome rejected the celebration of the Sacrament, tho upon different Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, but that they charged the Church, touching the ſubſtantial converſion of the Symbols of the Euchariſt into the Body and Blood of Chriſt, there is not one to be found, eſpecially of thoſe which have owned the truth of the Human Nature of the Son of God; at leaſt, no ſuch thing is to be ſeen in their Writings, nor in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Catalogues of Hereſies that ſtill remain, nor in the Polemical Writings of the Holy Doctors againſt Hereticks: for as for thoſe mentioned by the Author of the Letter unto thoſe of <hi>Smyrna,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Name of St. <hi>Ignatius,</hi> of whom we have ſpoken in the third Chapter of the firſt part; beſides, it is very uncertain if there were
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:47504:178"/>ever any ſuch, they denied the Myſtery of the Incarnation, and did not confeſs the truth of the humanity of Jeſus Chriſt; they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the Sacrament, the celebration whereof is a kind of confeſſing and owning the truth of his Human Nature, but neither they, nor any others have complained againſt the belief of the Church upon the ſubject of the Sacrament, they have not armed againſt her, nor have ſeparated from her Communion upon account of this Divine Myſtery, neither did the Church ever thunder out <hi>Anathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma</hi>'s nor Excommunications upon this Subject. From whence ſay ſome, proceeds ſo univerſal a Silence, and ſo great tranquillity upon ſo important an Article, which ſince <hi>Paſchas</hi> his time, that is to ſay the IXth Century, hath ſuffered ſuch an infinite number of Contradictions in the Weſt? for this Friar of <hi>Corby</hi> no ſooner pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his Opinion, but there oppoſed againſt him all the Learned Men of that Age, and it will appear in the courſe of this Treatiſe, that ever ſince that time, the Doctrine of the real preſence hath never been without a great many Oppoſers and Adverſaries, which for that reaſon have been Excommunicated, and eſteemed Hereticks by the Latin Church. When I make this reflection in my ſelf, ſaith the Proteſtant, that the Minds of Men have been at all times much of one and the ſame Temper, and been ever almoſt of the ſame Diſpoſition, and that beſides the liberty of writing and ſpeaking againſt the Doctrines of the Church, was never greater than in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity, nor leſs in the Weſt, than ſince the Condemnation of <hi>Beranger,</hi> I can find no other cauſe of ſo various and different proceeding, but the difference of Doctrine, which until <hi>Paſchas</hi> his time, was ſuch, that no Body had reaſon to take up Arms to diſpute againſt it; whereas ever ſince the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing of his Opinion, which altered the ancient Belief, there hath been made continual Reſiſtance and Oppoſition. Now I come to the Diſputes which the ancient Fathers have had againſt Hereticks, wherein they have imployed the Myſtery of the Euchariſt. The firſt which troubled the ſettlement of Chriſtianity were the <hi>Satur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nians,</hi> the <hi>Menandrians, Valentinians, Marcionites,</hi> and others. I intend not to burden my Paper with all the Impieties of theſe Wretches, but only to repreſent thoſe againſt which the holy Doctors have made uſe of the belief of the Holy Sacrament, and in what manner they have done it. I find then there were three hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Impieties held by theſe extravagant Perſons, againſt which they employed the Holy Sacrament; by the firſt, they taught that Jeſus Chriſt had not a true human Body, but a ſhadow of a Body, and a meer form void of ſubſtance or ſolidity. By the ſecond they ſaid, that the Father of Jeſus Chriſt was not the Creator of the World, but that the World and all Creatures which we ſee in it,
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:47504:179"/>are the effect of Paſſion, of Nature, and of Ignorance, and not of the Father of Jeſus Chriſt. And by the third, in fine, they ſaid, that all theſe material Creatures ſhould be wholly deſtroyed, and that by Conſequence our Bodies being of the number of theſe Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, ſhould not be raiſed, being uncapable of receiving ſuperna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Incorruption, nor of participating of the Grace of the Holy Spirit, Fleſh and Spirit not ſubſiſting both together. The Holy Fathers do alledge the Euchariſt to refute the firſt of theſe Impieties, but it is requiſite to know how they do alledge it; for if they had been in the belief of the Latin Church, they would not have failed, as the Proteſtants ſay, to have told theſe Hereticks that they over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>threw the Faith of the whole Church, which holds that the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread and Wine is turned into the Subſtance of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which could not be if he had not a true Body. They ſuppoſe this would have been the only means to have refuted them, and they think the Latins would have uſed this courſe had they to do with ſuch Hereticks. They ſay alſo, that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument would have been clear and convincing, and that 'tis to be believed the ancient Doctors would not have followed any other courſe if they had been of the ſame Opinions; that yet neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs they do not argue after that manner to refute the firſt Error of theſe Inſtruments of Satan; they only tell them, that ſeeing the Euchariſt is the Image and Figure of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, then of neceſſity he hath a true Body, becauſe every Image and Figure doth preſuppoſe the Exiſtence and Truth of the thing that it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents, and that it is the reaſoning of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> in his Excellent Treatiſe againſt <hi>Marcion;</hi>

                     <q>If Jeſus Chriſt (ſaith he) had neither Fleſh nor Blood, as the <hi>Marcionites</hi> affirm, of what Fleſh and Blood is it that he hath given us the Images, that is to ſay, the Bread and Wine of the Sacrament, when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded his Diſciples to remember him by thoſe things?</q> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the ſecond Impiety they alſo imply the Holy Sacrament, and ſee here how they do it.
<note place="margin">Tren. contr. he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſ. l. 4. c. 34.</note> They ſay, <q>The Holy Sacrament is an Acknowledgment which we make unto God, under the Title of Creator, in offering unto him the firſt Fruits of the Creatures which he hath made; and that it were an injuſtice to the Father of Jeſus Chriſt, if he were not the Creator of the World, to offer unto him things which belonged not unto him, as if he
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:47504:179"/>coveted that which belonged to another, and deſired to have what was not his own. That if the Creatures were the product of Paſſion, of Nature, and of Ignorance, it were to wrong God, inſtead of giving him Thanks, to offer him the Fruits of Paſſion, of Nature, and of Ignorance.</q> It is after this manner St. <hi>Ireneus</hi> doth argue to confute the Adverſaries which he oppoſed, in ſhewing them that the Father of Jeſus Chriſt muſt needs be the Creator of the World, becauſe he accepts the Oblations of Bread and Wine which is made unto him in the Euchariſt; for to ſay, that it is no longer Bread and Wine after Conſecration, but the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and that 'twas ſo St. <hi>Ireneus</hi> underſtood it, the Proteſtants ſay, this would have been yeilding the cauſe unto theſe Hereticks, who teaching that Jeſus Chriſt was not of the number of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of this World, would not have failed to have inferred that his Father had not been the Creator, becauſe our Lord was offered unto him, which was not the work of the Creator, whereas in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that there was offered unto him Creatures of this World, as theſe Hereticks owned, as well as the Orthodox, that there was ſuch offered unto him in the Euchariſt, he would have put them to ſilence, all the ſhifts they could have made would have vaniſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way at the ſight of this Truth, becauſe they confeſſed that Bread and Wine are of thoſe Creatures whereof the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt would not have received an Oblation, if he had not been the Maker of them: Something of this Nature is ſeen in <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullian</hi>'s firſt Book againſt <hi>Marcion, Chap.</hi> 14. It remains to ſee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what manner the Fathers have acted to refute the laſt Impiety of theſe Hereticks, who denied the reſurrection of the Body, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that all material Creatures ſhall be wholly deſtroyed and reduced to nothing,
<note place="margin">Iren. adverſ. haereſ. l 4. c. 34.</note> and that the Fleſh is uncapable of receiving Incorruption, becauſe Incorruption is a Grace of the Spirit, which can have no Commerce nor Society with the Fleſh; <q>We preach in the Euchariſt, (ſaith St. <hi>Ireneus</hi>) the Communion and Unity of the Fleſh and Spirit: for as the Bread which is of the Earth, receiving the Invocation of God, is no longer common Bread, but is the Sacrament, compoſed of two things, the one Terre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrial, the other Celeſtial; ſo alſo our Bodies receiving the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, are no more corruptible, having the hope of the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</q> If the Conſecration deſtroys the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine, it muſt be granted, ſay the Proteſtants, that this Holy Doctor took wrong Meaſures, when he would that the Bread of the Sacrament ſhould repreſent the Fleſh which is not deſtroyed under the Grace of the Spirit; becauſe if the Bread it ſelf be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, it cannot be employed to ſignify that our Fleſh ſhall not
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:47504:180"/>be deſtroyed. Seeing then that St. <hi>Ireneus</hi> doth uſe it to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, it muſt be ingeniouſly confeſſed, that he believed that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration did not annihilate the Nature and Subſtance of the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols.
<note place="margin">Tertul. contra Marc. l. 1. c. 14.</note> They ſay, moreover that <hi>Tertullian</hi> confirms them in this Opinion, when he ſaith, <q>The God of <hi>Marcion</hi> hath not yet rejected the Bread of the Creator, to repreſent his true Body, ſo that in his own Sacraments he hath need of borrowing the Goods of the Creator: But <hi>Marcion</hi> which is a Diſciple above his Maſter, and a Servant above his Lord, is much wiſer than him;</q> for he ruines what his Maſter would have. It plainly appears by theſe Words, that <hi>Marcion</hi> in deſtroying the Bread, that is to ſay, in teaching that it ſhall be deſtroyed, as being of the Creatures of this World, doth the quite contrary unto Jeſus Chriſt, who deſires it and uſeth it in his Sacrament, and that by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence preſerves the Subſtance of it: For if <hi>Tertullian,</hi> ſay they, had believed that he deſtroyed it in conſecrating of it, he would not have oppoſed, as he doth, the act of <hi>Marcion,</hi> or rather his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, which condemns it unto an entire deſtruction, unto the action of Jeſus Chriſt which makes uſe of it, and doth employ it. And becauſe there be ſeveral other things in the Works of this <hi>African</hi> Doctor againſt Hereticks, which may contribute unto this Hiſtory,
<note place="margin">Tertul. adverſ. Prax. c. 26.</note> I will inſtance ſome before I ſhall proceed farther. In his Book againſt <hi>Praxeas,</hi> he ſets it down for undoubted, <hi>That what is of a thing, is not the thing it ſelf:</hi> And it is thereupon he grounds the diſtinction of the Perſon of the Holy Ghoſt, from that of the Father; either his Maxim is falſe, ſay ſome, and very indiſcreetly propounded, or he did not believe that the Euchariſt was the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe it is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, by the confeſſion of all Chriſtians. Elſewhere diſputing againſt the Blaſphemy of <hi>Marcion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Id. adv. Marc. l. 3. c, 10.</note> who ſaid that Jeſus Chriſt had not a true Body, he ſaith, <q>That it was unworthy the Son of God to appear under a ſtrange ſhape; you make us, ſaith he to <hi>Marcion,</hi> a miſerable God, in that he could not ſhew his Chriſt but in Effigie of a thing unworthy of him. And preſently after; Wherefore did he not come in ſome other Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance more worthy of him? but eſpecially why did he not come in his own,</q> and not to ſeem to have had need of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is unworthy of him? Let Chriſtians judg, ſay the Proteſtants, if he could have ſpoke thus, and believe that Jeſus Chriſt doth every day appear under the Effigies and Reſemblance of Bread, but an appearance deſtitute of the ſubſtance and truth of Bread.
<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 8.</note> It is whereunto amounts alſo what is ſaid unto this Heretick in the ſame Book, <q>Jeſus Chriſt was not what he ſeemed to be, and diſguiſed what he was, being Fleſh, and not
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:47504:180"/>being ſo, being Man and not Man, and in like manner Chriſt, God, and not God; for what hinders but that he alſo bore the ſhadow of a God? ſhall I believe it of his interior ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, who deceived us by his exterior? how ſhall he be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved to be true in that which doth not appear, ſeeing he hath been found ſo falſe, in that which did appear?</q> See again if what he now ſaith can be accommodated with a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which teacheth that Jeſus Chriſt in the Euchariſt is not what he ſeems to be; for he ſeems to be Bread, and they will have it to be a bodily Subſtance: As for my particular, I am content to gueſs at what the Proteſtants infer from theſe Maxims. He again objects this to <hi>Marcion,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. c. 11.</note> 
                     <q>Thou honoureſt thy God with the title of a Deceiver, if he knew that he was any thing elſe than what he gave cauſe to Men to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he was.</q> The boldneſs, or rather raſhneſs, ſay they, of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> cannot enough be admired ſo to purſue and force <hi>Marcion,</hi> if the Church of his time had been of the belief the Latin Church is now of. And in another Book of the ſame Treatiſe, he refutes the ſhadow of this Arch Heretick, by the Hiſtory of the penitent Sinner in the Goſpel,

                     <hi>In that ſhe kiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>the Feet of Jeſus, in that ſhe waſhed them with her Tears, and wiped them with the Hairs of her Head, in that ſhe poured precious Ointment upon him, it ſhews that ſhe handled a true real Body, and not an empty ſhadow.</hi> All the World, as they think, may obſerve, that if the Chriſtians of thoſe times had believed what the Latins believe, <hi>Marcion</hi> would undoubtedly have oppoſed unto the example of the Sinner which <hi>Tertullian</hi> preſſeth againſt him, that of the Euchariſt, which is handled, which is received into the Stomack, wherewith a living Body may be nouriſhed, which is ſubject to Mouldineſs and ſeveral other the like Accidents, and that it may not for all this be concluded according to the Doctrine of the Roman-Church, that it is the true ſubſtance of Bread, and not barely Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and Appearances. In another Treatiſe ſpeaking to the ſame Heretick,

                     <q>Wherefore (ſaith he) will you that one half of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould be a Fiction? he was nothing but Truth, wholly and intirely. Believe me, he choſe rather to be born, than to lye in any reſpect whatſoever.</q> And there again, he adds, that according to the Doctrine of <hi>Marcion,</hi> 
                     <q>Jeſus Chriſt had Fleſh, hard without Bones, ſolid without Nerves, bloody without Blood, covered without Garments, a Body that was hungry without Appetite, that eat without Teeth, and ſpake without a Tongue; ſo that his Words were but
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:47504:181"/>a Shadow which deceived the Ear by the ſound of a Voice: And in fine, he preſſeth in the ſame Chapter by the Words of our Saviour to his Diſciples after the Reſurrection, <hi>See that it is I,</hi> for a Spirit hath not Fleſh and Bones as you ſee me have:</q> Then he adds, that if Jeſus Chriſt according to the fancy of this Heretick had not truly Fleſh and Bones, it follows that when he ſo preſented the Appearances unto his Diſciples, he openly deceived them, in ſhewing them that for Bones, which were not ſo in effect: <q>See, (ſaith he) he ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſeth, he deceiveth, he abuſeth the Eyes, the Senſes, the coming near, and touching of all his Diſciples.</q> There needs not ſay they, much ſubtilty and wit to comprehend, that <hi>Tertullian</hi> could not by theſe kinds of Arguments deſtroy the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of his Adverſary, without at the ſame time giving mortal blows to the Euchariſt of Orthodox Chriſtians of his time, if it had been the ſame with that of the Latins. But becauſe thoſe which know the rare Genius of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> will never accuſe him of ſo great Imprudence, it muſt of neceſſity be concluded, that the belief of the Church of his time, upon the point of the Sacrament, was quite contrary unto that of the Latin Church; they think one cannot chuſe but make this concluſion, which I leave unto the Reader's Liberty. And from this Diſpute of <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Marcion,</hi> I proceed un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to that which the ancient Church had againſt the <hi>Encratites,</hi> which deteſting Wine as a Diabolical thing, and ſinful to be uſed, did celebrate the Myſteries with bare Water. What have the Holy Fathers ſaid unto them? how have they refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Hereſy? have they ſaid unto them, that our Saviour having employed Wine to the matter of this Sacrament, bare Water cannot be converted into the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt? have they further ſaid to them, that the averſion they had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Wine, ſhould not hinder them from uſing it in the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of the Euchariſt, becauſe though it were Wine be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Conſecration, yet it was not after, the ſubſtance of it being changed by the vertue of Conſecration into the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the real Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and that ſo 'tis no longer Wine which we drink, but the real Blood of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of the World? they have ſaid nothing of all this unto them: but then what have they ſaid unto them? they have conſtantly repreſented that Jeſus Chriſt <hi>Offered Wine which be gave, and drank thereof;</hi> Which they prove by theſe Words, <hi>I will no more drink of this Fruit of the Vine, until the day I drink it new in my Fathers Kingdom.</hi> It is in this manner that

                     <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> St. <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> argued againſt theſe Hereticks as hath been ſhewn in the ſecond Chapter of the firſt part. But it is enough ſpoken to this matter; it is time to conclude this Chapter, and by the ſame means I will conclude the Proofs drawn from the Diſputes of the. Holy Fathers againſt Hereticks, by the conſideration of what paſſed betwixt them and the <hi>Eutychians.</hi> The Hereſy of the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> following the ſame Track of the moſt part of others, ſought out Artifices and Invention; the eaſier to inſinuate it ſelf into the Minds of Men, thereby to make the greater Progreſs: For although for the moſt part, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared there was two Natures in Jeſus Chriſt, but that at the inſtant of his being received up into the Heavenly Glory, the Human Nature was changed into the Nature or Subſtance of the Divine Nature; yet nevertheleſs, I conceive, to ſpeak tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, their Hereſy was not much different in this point from the Hereſy of <hi>Marcion,</hi> and his Companions, which formerly denied the Truth of Chriſt's Human Nature, and only attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted unto him a Shew and Appearance. And what makes me think ſo, is, that the ancient Doctors of the Church do teſtify, that <hi>Eutyches</hi> did teach that Jeſus Chriſt took nothing of the ſubſtance of the Holy Virgin; but having brought I know not what Body of his own from his Heavenly Father, he only paſſed through the Womb of the Bleſſed Virgin, as through a Channel, I will not inſiſt upon alledging all the Paſſages of the Fathers which mention this, it ſhall ſuffice to inſtance in ſome few.

<note place="margin">Theod. dial. 2. p. 84. t. 4.</note> and by its Picture. <q>An Image, ſay they, muſt of neceſſity have its Original, for Painters do imitate Nature, and delineate things which they do ſee; if then the Divine Myſteries are the Figures or Anti-types of a true Body, it follows that our Saviour hath now a Body, not changed into the Nature of the Divinity, but filled with the Divine Glory.</q> It is the reaſoning of <hi>Theodoret</hi> in his ſecond Dialogue, which he repeats again in two other places. I cannot comprehend, ſaith the Proteſtant, the meaning of this ancient Doctor, if the Doctrine of the real Converſion, at that time, was an Article of Faith in the Church, wherefore to alledg the Sacrament as an Image and a Figure, to prove the verity of the Body of Chriſt, if it were really and truly the very Body it ſelf; I cannot underſtand this Difficulty, but in freely confeſſing that Chriſtians at that time did not know nor believe this real Converſion; whence it was that <hi>Theodo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi> did argue againſt the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> juſt as <hi>Tertullian</hi> had done before againſt the <hi>Marcionites.</hi> The Evidence of this Truth will yet better appear if it be conſidered, that there was an univerſal Peace amongſt the Orthodox and the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> touching the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, which Peace had been incompatible with the belief of the ſubſtantial Converſion, which the <hi>Eutychians</hi> could not have admitted without pulling down with one Hand, what they built with the other; that is to ſay, without deſtroying what they taught, that Jeſus Chriſt had not a true Body. But to the end no ſcruple may reſt here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon in the Mind of the Reader, let us hear this Dialogue
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:47504:182"/>of <hi>Theodoret</hi> with an <hi>Eutychian.</hi>

Compare now this Image with its Original, and you ſhall ſee the reſemblance which is betwixt them, for the Figure ought to reſemble the Original. The Body of Jeſus Chriſt keepeth his firſt Form, his firſt Figure, and his firſt Circumſcription, and in a word it hath the ſubſtance of a Body; but after the Reſurrection it was made immortal and incorruptible, it is ſitting on the right Hand of God, and all Creatures do adore it, becauſe it is called the Lord of Nature. <hi>Heret.</hi> But the Myſtical Symbol doth change its former Name, for it is no longer called what it was before, but it is called the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, whence it follows, that the Truth (which anſwers the Sign) ſhould be called God, and not Body. <hi>Orthod.</hi> It ſeems to me you are in Darkneſs, for the Symbol is not only called Body, but Bread of Life, the Lord himſelf calleth it ſo; and as for the Body it ſelf, we call it a Divine Body, a quickning Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, the Body of our Lord; meaning thereby, that it is not the Body of an Ordinary Perſon, but the Body of Jeſus
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:47504:183"/>Chriſt our Lord which is God and Man.</q> This Diſcourſe being written as it were with a Sun-Beam, to uſe <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s Expreſſion, hath no need of Explication. Therefore we will here put an end to the proofs of the belief of the Holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, to proceed to the Inquiry into the Changes arrived firſt in the Expreſſions, and then afterwards in the Doctrine it ſelf.</p>

                     <p>Of the change which came to paſs in the Expreſſions, or the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory of the Seventh Century.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ALthough Cuſtom in Speech be a very capricious Maſter, and exerciſeth, over the words which are ſubject unto its Tyrannical Government, an abſolute Authority, rejecting or uſing them at pleaſure, or rather after its wild Fancy; Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, there are certain expreſſions ſo confirmed by long uſe, and ſo particularly adapted to ſignifie certain things, that they cannot be Aboliſhed without diſturbing the Commerce and Society of Men, and without forgetting by degrees, and inſenſibly, the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of thoſe things, for the repreſentation whereof they were deſigned: If this may befall in things of Civil Society, much more is it to be feared in things of a Religious Nature; becauſe for the moſt part, the conſequences and effects are more fatal and dangerous; therefore it was, the Ancient Chriſtians were ſo care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of exactly retaining certain terms and manner of Expreſſions, which had been as 'twere conſecrated in the Church, and which could not be changed without opening the Door unto ſome alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration in the Doctrine; ſo certain it is that we muſt not remove the bounds which our Fore-fathers have ſet. It is upon this ground and motive, that it was ſaid throughout the whole extent of Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, for above the ſpace of ſix hundred years, That the Euchariſt was the Sacrament, the Sign, the Symbole, the Image, the Figure, the Type, the Antitype, the Similitude and the Repreſentation of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, it never being ſeen in ſo conſiderable a ſpace of time in that vaſt and ſpacious Empire, that there was any body that of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to queſtion Expreſſions that were ſo well Eſtabliſhed, and moreover ſo conſtantly and univerſally received as they were. Nevertheleſs in the Seventh Century there was ſprung up in Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> a certain Friar called <hi>Anaſtatius,</hi> which raſhly paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over the Bounds that in this regard had been obſerved, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected the term of Sign or Figure, which was commonly uſed until his time. But not to confound this <hi>Anaſtatius</hi> with others of the ſame name, which had been Patriarchs of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and alſo to diſcover the Age wherein he lived; it muſt be noted, that himſelf obſerves, that being at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> he was told,
<note place="margin">Anneſtat. Sin. in c. 10.</note> that a good while after the Death of the Patriarch <hi>Eulogius,</hi> there was in that City an Auguſtal Prefect, which favoured the party
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:47504:184"/>of the <hi>Severian Hereticks,</hi> and who to this effect had contributed in corrupting the Writings of the Ancients. Now <hi>Eulogius</hi> dyed by every bodies confeſſion in the year of our Lord 608. This was not told unto <hi>Anaſtatius</hi> until a conſiderable time had paſt after the death of <hi>Eulogius,</hi> let us ſay it may be about 20 or 22 years, which is the leaſt can be allowed: <hi>Anaſtatius</hi> then could not be informed of this matter till the year 630. and he could be nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the two <hi>Anaſtatiuſes</hi> that were Patriarchs of <hi>Antioch,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laſt was murdered by the Jews in the year 608. Beſides, he writes, that being at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> there aroſe a queſtion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome words of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> which had been Biſhop of the ſame place after his Uncle <hi>Theophilus,</hi> which had been corrupted and altered; and that then one <hi>Iſidor,</hi> Library Keeper, and truly Orthodox, produc'd a Copy, an Exemplification of the Writings of St. <hi>Cyril,</hi> which had not been adulterated; which ſheweth, that in all likelihood the Patriarch was Orthodox: for if he had been an <hi>Eutychian,</hi> he would not have tolerated a Library Keeper that had been Orthodox, and an Enemy to his Belief: therefore it may be concluded, if I be not deceived, that it hapned about they year 630.
<note place="margin">Hiſt. Miſcel. l. 18.</note> And becauſe <hi>Anaſtatius</hi> wrote ſome time after, there being yet in <hi>Egypt</hi> an Auguſtal Prefect, it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that he wrote about the year 637. And before the year 639.

                     <hi>Tell me I pray, the Communion of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which you offer, and whereof you are partakers, is it the true Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, or common Bread, as that which is ſold in Markets; or only a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as the Sacrifice of the Goat offered by the Jews. Whereunto the Heretick having anſwered, God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid we ſhould ſay that the Holy Communion is the Figure of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt, or bare Bread.</hi> Anaſtatius <hi>replies, We believe it to be ſo, and confeſs it according to Chriſt's words to his Diſciples, when in the Myſtical Supper he gave them the Bread of Life, ſaying,</hi> Take, Eat, this is my Body; <hi>He alſo gave them the Cup, ſaying,</hi> This is my Blood: <hi>He ſaid not this is the Figure of my Body and Blood.</hi> He is the firſt that deviated from the uſual Expreſſions, and that denied what all the holy Fathers before him had affirmed, and ſome alſo after him, as we have ſhewed in the Third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this Second Part: And have ſhewn, that theſe holy Fathers
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:47504:184"/>teſtifie, That when our Lord gave his Euchariſt to his Apoſtles, he gave them the Figure of his Body. <hi>Anaſtatius</hi> then denying what the others affirmed, according to the Maxim of <hi>Vincentius Lirinenſis,</hi> his Opinion ſhould be rejected as an Opinion private and peculiar to himſelf, and we are firmly and conſtantly to hold and embrace the publick and univerſal Belief; but becauſe the words of Authors are favourably to be interpreted, at leaſt as much as may be; ſome ſay it ſhould be ſo done towards <hi>Anaſtatius,</hi> and that 'tis eaſie to give a good ſenſe unto what he ſaid. He declares the Euchariſt is the true Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; he ſaith nothing as they think, that being rightly underſtood, but is very reaſonable; becauſe it is moſt certain, that the Sacrament is unto the faithful Soul inſtead of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; that he truly communicates unto him this broken Body, and this Blood poured out for his Conſolation and Salvation; and that it is changed, as St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> ſpeaks, into the Efficacy of his Body. If <hi>Anaſtatius</hi> ſay they erred in rejecting the word Sign and Figure, the Fathers both before and after him having uſed it, it cannot be believed that he hath changed any thing in the ground of the Doctrine: they think ſo for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral reaſons; in the firſt place he ſaith, it is not ſimple Bread as is ſold in the Markets; for thus ſpeaking, is to acknowledge that it is Bread, which by Conſecration hath acquired the qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of an Efficacious and Divine Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, of whom for that reaſon, it takes the name, as it hath the virtue and efficacy in its lawful uſe; as when the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſay of the Waters of Baptiſm and the Oyl of <hi>Chriſin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cyril. Hieroſ. Catech. 3. il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum &amp; Myſtag. 3.</note> that it is not common Water and common Oyl, they deny not that it is Water and Oyl, they only mean, that it is Water and Oyl ſanctified to be the Symboles of the waſhing and purifying our Souls by the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, and by the Vertue of the Holy Ghoſt. Secondly, He declares that it is not a Figure, as the Sacrifice of the Goat which the Jews offered, that is a Type and Figure without efficacy and vertue, having taken this name of Type and Figure, for a Legal Figure, and without Operation; in which ſenſe it is true, that the Communion is not a Figure and bare Type, deſtitute of the truth, like the Types and Figures of the Law, whereof he produceth an Example in the Sacrifice of the Goat. In the third place he ſpeaks of a Body of the Lord, <hi>Which being kept in a Veſſel, corrupts in few days,
<note place="margin">Id. Anaſt. Ibid. c. 23.</note> changeth and quite altereth; of a Body and Blood,</hi> which as he ſaith in another Chapter of the ſame Treatiſe, <hi>may be broken, divided,
<note place="margin">Id. c. 13. Ibid. c. 13.</note> and diſtrihuted in parcels, broken with the Teeth, changed, poured out and drank.</hi> And in the ſame Chapter he ſaith, <hi>That the Body and
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:47504:185"/>Blood diſtributed unto the People, ſaying, The Body and Blood of our Lord God and Saviour, is a Viſible Body, created and taken from the Earth.</hi> They conclude then, that if there was imprudence in his expreſſions, there was no Error in his Doctrine, and they are very much confirmed in this Opinion, which I freely remit unto the judgment of others, if they conſider the Doctrine had received no Oppoſition in the Eaſt nor Weſt;

                     <p>Wherein is examined what paſſed in the Eighth Century.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AS <hi>Anaſtatius,</hi> a Frier of Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> had rejected the name of Sign or Figure; not allowing to ſay, that the Sacrament is only the Sign of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; words which might receive a good Conſtruction, as hath been declared in the precedent Chapter: ſo <hi>John Damaſcen,</hi> ſurnamed <hi>Manſur,</hi> ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Frier of the Eaſt, extraordinarily given to the worſhiping of Images, and therefore Anathematized by 338 Biſhops, <hi>Anno</hi> 754. bethought himſelf in the Eighth Century of condemning the terms of Image, of Type, and Figure; but becauſe he ſtopped not at Expreſſions, but proceeded to the Doctrine, it is requiſite
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:47504:186"/>to ſee if he therein made any Alteration, and if his Innovation fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured the Belief of the Latin Church. See here then what he ſaith:
<note place="margin">Damaſc. de Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de Orthod. l. 4. c. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>The Bread offered, the Wine, and the Water are ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally changed, by the Invocation and coming of the Holy Ghoſt into the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; and are not two, but one and the ſame thing.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> And a little after; <hi>The Bread and Wine are not the Type, or the Figure of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt: Ah, God forbid; but the Body it ſelf of our Lord Deified: our Lord himſelf ſaying,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> This is, <hi>not the Figure of my Body, but</hi> my Body; <hi>not the Figure of my Blood, but</hi> my Blood. And again; <hi>If ſome have cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the Bread and Wine Figures, or Signs of the Body and Blood, as St.</hi> Baſil, <hi>they ſpake not after Conſecration, but they called them ſo before the Oblation was conſecrated.</hi> As there are two things in theſe words of <hi>Damaſcen;</hi> the one regarding the Terms, the other the Doctrine, we are obliged to examine both, to give the Reader all the Information he may expect of us in this matter. I will begin with the Doctrine, to ſee if it agreeth with that of the Latin Church: If <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſaid, that the ſubſtance of the Sym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bols were quite deſtroyed, and that if paſſed into the ſubſtance it ſelf of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo that there remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no part of the Bread and Wine but the bare Accidents only, which ſubſiſted miraculouſly without their Subject, it muſt be granted that he was of the ſame Opinion that Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks are of at this time; and it were very unjuſt to deny it: But if on the other hand, he ſo plainly expreſſed himſelf, that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted but he believed that the ſubſtance of the Symbols remained, whatever Change it was that intervened by Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, it muſt of neceſſity be concluded, that his Belief upon this Point was not the Belief of the Latin Church. The better to ſucceed in this Enquiry, it muſt be noted that he lays this down for a certain Maxim;
<note place="margin">Id. Dialect. c. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Accident cannot ſubſiſt in it ſelf, but hath its Being in another Subject;
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that the Soul is a Subſtance, and Wiſdom an Accident; that the Soul being taken away, Wiſdom alſo periſheth:
<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 28.</note> That which ſubſiſteth not of it ſelf, but hath its Exiſtence in another,
<note place="margin">Id. de Fide Orthod. l. 1. c. 17.</note> is an Accident.</hi> He affirms again, <hi>That nothing but the Divinity is infinite; that Bodies have beginning and ending, and a bodily place,
<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 4.</note> and that they may be held; that what is inviſible and impaſſible is not a Body.</hi> All which things do not well accord with the Real Preſence,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> no more than his reſtraining the Inviſible Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, whereby our Saviour is with us, <hi>unto the Preſence of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity.</hi> Moreover, he affirms poſitively that the ſubſtance of Bread remains, and that it nouriſheth our Body by turning into our ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.
<note place="margin">Id. l. 4. c. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>The Shew-bread,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>did repreſent this Bread, and it is the pure and unbloody Sacrifice which our Lord foretold by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:47504:186"/>which ſhould be offered unto him throughout the whole World; to wit, the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which paſſeth into the ſubſtance of our Body and Soul, without being conſumed, corrupted, or paſſing into the Draft: Ah, God forbid; but paſſing into our Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance for our Preſervation.</hi> All Chriſtians confeſs that this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid of the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as neither can it be ſaid of bare Accidents; it muſt then be underſtood of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread which is called the Body of Chriſt, becauſe it is the Sacrament of it: From thence it is, the ſame <hi>Damaſcen</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares the Change which befalls the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt unto that which happens unto the Water of Baptiſm. <hi>As in Baptiſm</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>becauſe Men are wont to waſh themſelves with Water,
<note place="margin">Id. Ibid.</note> and to anoint them with Oyl, God hath joyned unto the Water and Oyl the Grace of the Holy Spirit, and hath made it the Waſhing of Regeneration; ſo alſo in like manner, they being accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomed to eat Bread, and to drink Wine and Water, he hath joyned them unto his Divinity, and hath made them his Body and Blood.</hi> His Similitude would not be juſt, if the ſubſtance of the Symbols did not remain in the Euchariſt, as well as in Baptiſm. He uſeth alſo another, which farther illuſtrates the nature of this Change.
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Eſay (ſaith he) <hi>ſaw a Coal; now a Coal is not meer Wood, but it is joyned with Fire: ſo the Bread of the Sacrament is not bare Bread, but it is joyned to the Divinity; and the Body united to the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, is not one and the ſame Nature; but the Nature of the Body is one, and that of the Divinity united unto it is another.</hi> Every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy may eaſily underſtand that the Coal united to the Fire, keeps its ſubſtance, although that by a kind of Change, it becomes red, and like Fire: Therefore by the ſenſe of the Compariſon, it muſt needs be, that the Bread of the Euchariſt doth keep its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, although it be in ſome ſort changed by its being joyned to the Divinity; and that ſo the Change which comes to the Bread and Wine of the Sacrament, according to <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> is quite dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from that which is taught by the Latin Church; and I think it cannot be any way queſtioned, after what is above ſaid. Now, if I be asked what was the Belief of <hi>Damaſcen;</hi> for if it be not the Belief of Roman Catholicks, it ſhould in all like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood be that of Proteſtants? I anſwer ſincerely, that as far as I can judge, it is not the Belief, neither of the one, or the other; but a particular Opinion of this Friar; who believed that the Bread and Wine, by the coming of the Holy Ghoſt, were in ſome ſort united to the Divinity, which took them unto it ſelf (for he uſeth the term of Aſſumption) as it took the Humane Nature of our Saviour; and that by means of this Union to the Divinity, they became one and the ſame Body, and not ſeveral,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:47504:187"/>as he explained himſelf in the firſt paſſage: an Unity which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon this known <hi>Axiom; That the things united unto a third, are united amongſt themſelves.</hi> Methinks the Author declares his meaning plainly enough, when having made himſelf this Queſtion, <hi>How is it that the Bread is made the Body of Jeſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and the Wine and Water his Blood?</hi> He anſwers, <hi>The Holy Spirit comes and changes theſe things in a manner that ſurpaſſeth expreſſion and thought.</hi> The Bread and Wine are taken; which is juſt the term uſed by the Fathers to repreſent the Aſſumption of the Humane Nature of Jeſus Chriſt by the Divinity.</p>
                  <p>The Sentiments of <hi>Damaſcen</hi> will appear yet plainer, if we conſider what he ſaith in his Letter unto <hi>Zachary,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Doare,</hi> and in the little Chapter which follows; to wit, <hi>That the Bread and Wine of the Sacrament are made the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt by way of Augmentation or Increaſe, which befalls the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> Thus he eſtabliſheth the Subſiſtence of theſe two Elements, and their joyning unto the natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt; but ſo ſtrict an Union, that they make, in the ſhallow Conceit of this Writer, but one ſingle Body, with the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt. Moreover, he aſſures that <hi>the incorruptible Body of our Saviour,</hi> that is to ſay, his glorified Body, <hi>hath no Blood:</hi> a Doctrine with which it is impoſſible to reconcile the Belief of Tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                  <p>As to what <hi>Damaſcen</hi> ſaith, That the Fathers have given to the Bread and Wine in the Sacrament the names of Figures and Signs before Conſecration, and not after, he apparently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf: for do but read what we have alledged in the third Chapter of this ſecond Part, where we have eſtabliſhed this Tradition by a very great number of teſtimonies of this holy Doctors. The Abbot of <hi>Billy</hi> a very Learned Man, and well read in Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity, could not ſuffer this preſumption of <hi>Damaſcen</hi>'s without reproving him,
<note place="margin">Billius in Orat. 11. Greg. Naz. p. 632.</note> by, as it were, giving him the lye. <hi>Damaſcen</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>denies that the Bread and Wine are called Figures after Conſecration by</hi> St. Baſil, <hi>which is evidently falſe;</hi> as plainly appears by ſeveral places in the Apoſtolical Conſtitutions of St. <hi>Clement,</hi> of <hi>Gregory Nazianzen,</hi> and other Authors.

                     <hi>Beſſareon</hi> a Greek by Nation, Biſhop of <hi>Nice,</hi> and one of thoſe which aſſiſted at the Council of <hi>Florence</hi> in behalf of the Greek Nation, but corrupted by the <hi>Latins,</hi> who ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured him with a Cardinals Cap, excuſeth <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to give a good ſenſe to his words; By <hi>the Figure</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>whereof he ſpeaks in this place, he means a ſhadow, which is nothing elſe but a Figure, ſimply ſignifying another ſubject, having not at all, any force nor power, to act or operate; like the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:47504:187"/>of the Old Teſtament, which were the Figures of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the New.</hi> But this Explication which is not wholly to be rejected, doth not hinder but that the Cenſure of the Abbot of <hi>Billy</hi> was very Judicious. In fine, About the ſame time <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcen</hi> denied it, <hi>Stephen Stylite,</hi> no leſs zealous than him for the defence of Images, confeſſed it, when he ſaid to the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> which commanded them to be taken out of Churches, <hi>Will you alſo baniſh out of the Church the Signs or Figures of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Vita Stephan. apud Surcum ad 28 Novem. cap. 36.</note> ſeeing that is an Image and a true Figure.</hi> But let us yet make ſome progreſs in the Eaſt and Weſt, to know what was the Language and Doctrine of the Church in the Eighth Century. As for what concerns the Weſt,
<note place="margin">Bede in Luc. cap. 22. Id. in Pſal. 3. Id. in Hemil. de Sanct. in Epiph. Idem in Pſal. 133. t. 8. Id. de tabern. l. 2. c. 2. t. 4.</note> if we enquire of venerable <hi>Bede</hi> he will tell us, <hi>That the Lord gave us the Sacrament of his Fleſh and Blood, in the Figure of Bread and Wine: And that our Saviour gave unto his Diſciples in his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament the Figure of his Body and Blood; That the Creatures of Bread and Wine paſs into the Sacrament of his Body and Blood, by the ineffable ſanctification of the Holy Ghoſt; That our Saviour hath changed the Legal Sacrifices, into Sacrifices of Bread and Wine: And that whereas the Ancients celebrated the Paſſion of our Lord in the Fleſh and Blood of Sacrifices, we celebrate it in the Oblation of Bread and Wine:</hi> According to which he teſtifies in a great many places,
<note place="margin">Homil. de Sanct. in E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piph.</note> as hath been ſeen in the 4th Chapter, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is abſent from us as to his Body, but is preſent by his Divinity.</hi> It is true he ſaith, <hi>That the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt is received by the Mouth of believers for their Salvation.</hi> But after what he hath ſpoken, it is very evident, ſay the Proteſtants, that he ſpeaks not of receiving them in their matter and Subſtance, but in their Sacrament, accompanied with a quickning and ſaving virtue; and that if he be not ſo underſtood, he will be made to contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict himſelf, and to deſtroy with one hand, what he built with the other; therefore it is that he diſtinguiſheth the Sacrament; and that he declares, that the wicked participate only of the Sign, and not of the thing ſignified, ſaying with St. <hi>Proſper</hi> in the Sentences drawn from St. <hi>Auſtin,
<note place="margin">Id. in 1. ad Cor. 11.</note> He that is not reconciled unto Jeſus Chriſt, neither eats his Fleſh, nor drinketh his Blood, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he receiveth every day the Sacrament of ſo great a thing unto his condemnation.</hi> It is alſo true, that he often calls the Bread and Wine, the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; but he declareth with St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> whom he exactly follows,
<note place="margin">Id. in cap. 6. ad Rom. Id. in Marc. cap. 14.</note> 
                     <hi>That it is by reaſon of the reſemblance they have with the things whereof they are Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:</hi> And with St. <hi>Iſidor</hi> of <hi>Sevil, That it is becauſe Bread ſtrengthens the body, and Wine increaſeth Blood in the Fleſh; and that for this reaſon, the Bread relates myſtically unto the Body of Jeſus
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:47504:188"/>Chriſt, and the Wine to his Blood.</hi> And becauſe, ſay they, in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Sacraments, it is not ſo much to be conſider'd what they be,
<note place="margin">Auguſt. contra Maxim. l. 3. c. 22.</note> ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> as what it is they ſignifie; <hi>becauſe that as Signs they are one thing, and yet they do ſignifie another.</hi> Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Bede</hi> makes no difficulty to ſay, <hi>That the Bread and Wine being viſibly offered, another thing muſt be underſtood which is Inviſible,</hi> to wit, <hi>The true Body and Blood of Chriſt;</hi> becauſe in effect, he will have the Believer raiſe up his Soul and his Faith unto Jeſus Chriſt, ſitting at the right Hand of his Father; for as he told us before, <hi>He carried by his Aſcenſion into the Inviſible Heavens,
<note place="margin">Beda domui vocem Ju. Id. Hom. de Aſtil. de temp. in vigil.

Unto <hi>Bede</hi> may be joyned <hi>Sedulius,</hi> a Scotchman, or more truly, an Iriſhman; not him that compoſed the <hi>Eaſter</hi> work, who was much later than the other; I mean the Author of the Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries upon the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which many attribute unto one <hi>Sedulius</hi> a Biſhop in <hi>England,</hi> but originally of <hi>Ireland;</hi> who aſſiſted with <hi>Ferguſt</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>Scotland,</hi> at a Council held at <hi>Rome</hi> under <hi>Gregory</hi> the 2d. <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 721.

Now this <hi>Sedulius</hi> whom we place in the VIII.

                     <note place="margin">Vita Leufred. C. 17. in Chron Inſulae term.</note> about the beginning of the VIII.

                  <p>They indeed obſerve, that to ſhew of what kind the change whereof he ſpeaks is, he ſaith, <hi>In celebrating the Euchariſt,

                     <hi>That the Elevation of the precious body, repreſents the Elevation in the Croſs, the Death of our Lord on the Croſs, and his Reſurrection alſo; That the Prieſt receiving the Bread alone, without the Blood, and the Blood alſo without the Body, ſignifies nothing elſe, but that the Divine Lamb is yet all bloody; and that we eat the Bread and drink the Cup, as the Fleſh and Blood of the Son of God, confeſſing his Death and Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</hi> And clearer yet in theſe words, where ſpeaking of the holy Bread, which he diſtinguiſheth from Jeſus Chriſt, he ſaith,

                     <hi>That it is the only Bread wherein is figured and repreſented the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and all-healing Death of him which was Sacrificed for the Lafe
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:47504:189"/>of the World; becauſe it is the only Divine Bread which is Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed and Offered as the Lamb: but as for the other Divine Gifts, they be not cut in the form of a Croſs with the Knife, but they are put in pieces as the members and parts of the body.</hi> It is the true Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary of what he ſaith in the ſame Treatiſe, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is always ſacrificed,</hi> becauſe he is ſo, not in himſelf, for that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, by the confeſſion of all Chriſtians, <hi>but in the Sacrament;</hi> the Celebration whereof doth lively repreſent unto us the imolation of Jeſus Chriſt upon the Croſs.
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 408.</note> Add unto this that he declares, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt drank Wine in his Sacrament, as he did after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, not through neceſſity, but to perſwade his Diſciples of the truth of his Reſurrection.</hi> And that he deſires at the inſtant of communicating, we ſhould lift up our thoughts from Earth, unto the King which is in Heaven. Now let it be judged after all theſe declarations, what the change can be, which he ſaith is paſſed upon the Bread and Wine by Conſecration, if he meant a change of ſubſtance, or only of uſe and condition; for the former ſeems unto Proteſtants to be inconſiſtent with the Expla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations which he hath given us; whereas the latter doth not ill accord with it, in all appearance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>German</hi> ſaith, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is ſeen and felt in the Euchariſt;</hi> but he poſitively affirms, that it is done in his Sacrament; that is to ſay, that he is ſeen and touched, inaſmuch as the Sacrament is ſeen and felt which doth repreſent him.
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 401.</note> 
                     <hi>Our Saviour</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is ſeen, and ſuffers himſelf to be touched by means of the ever to be revered and ſacred Myſteries.</hi> I will not inſiſt upon what is ſaid by this Patriarch, That the Bread and Wine offered by Believers for the Communion, do in ſome ſort become upon the Table of propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition (which amongſt the Greeks is different from that where the Conſecration of the Divine Symbols are made) I ſay they become in ſome ſort the Images and Figures of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe it is a frivolous conceit, and with reaſon rejected by Roman Catholicks and Proteſtants.</p>

<note place="margin">Concil. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinop. in Act. Concil. Nicaen. 2. t. 5. Concil. p. 756.</note> clearing up the Doctrine of the Church upon the point of the Sacrament, to draw a proof againſt the ſame Images they had condemned, they left unto us for a Monument of their belief, this following teſtimony; <hi>Let thoſe rejoyce which with a
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:47504:189"/>moſt pure heart, make the true Image of Jeſus Chriſt, which deſire, which venerate, and which do offer it for the Salvation of body and ſoul; the which Jeſus Chriſt gave unto his Diſciples in Figure and Commemoration.</hi> And having repeated the words of Inſtitution, they add, <hi>That no other Species under Heaven was made choice of by him, nor any other Type that could repreſent his Incarnation; That it is the Image of his quickning body, which was honourably and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly made; That as Jeſus Chriſt took the matter or humane ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in like manner he hath commanded us to offer for his Image a matter choſen,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>the ſubſtance of bread, not having any humane Form or Figure, fearing leſt Idolatry may get in; As then</hi> (ſay they) <hi>the Natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt is holy, becauſe it is Deified: It is alſo evident, that his Body by Inſtitution,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>his holy Image is rendred Divine by Sanctification of Grace: for it is what our Saviour intended to do, when by virtue of the Union, he Deified the Fleſh he had taken by a Sanctification proper unto himſelf; ſo alſo he would, that the bread of the Sacrament, as being the true Figure of his Natural body, ſhould be made a Divine Body by the coming of the Holy Ghoſt, the Prieſt which makes the Oblation intervening to make it holy, whereas it was common; therefore the Natural body of our Lord, endowed with Soul and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, was anointed by the Holy Ghoſt, being united unto the Godhead; ſo alſo his Image,</hi> to wit, <hi>the holy bread is filled with the Cup of enlivening Blood which flowed out of his ſide.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What renders this teſtimony the more conſiderable and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to be credited, is, That theſe Fathers which repreſented all the Eaſtern Church, or at leaſt the greateſt part of it, were aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled about the matter of Images, and not about the ſubject of the Sacrament; for had they been aſſembled upon the point of the Sacrament, it may be ſome uncharitable perſon might ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect them of pre-occupation, or of deſign; but having been aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled upon a very different ſubject, of neceſſity it muſt be granted, that it is by the by, that they inform us of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and general Opinion and Belief of Chriſtians. They would draw from the Euchariſt an argument againſt the uſe and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Images; and to do it the better, they were obliged to unfold unto us the Nature of the Sacrament; and they explain it in ſaying, That it is the ſubſtance of Bread; that it is no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving Figure of his Natural Body; and as they ſay a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, a Type and Commemoration of the Paſſion of Jeſus Chriſt; and that God in chooſing this Type, and not a humane Effigies, intended to ſhun the danger of Idolatry; they content not them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to ſay, that the Euchariſt is an Image; they declare, That this Image is the ſubſtance of Bread; they ſpeak of Sacrificing
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:47504:190"/>this Image, this choſen matter, this Subſtance of Bread; they pleaſed themſelves in making a perpetual oppoſition betwixt the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Bread which is its Figure or Image; they ſay, That <hi>the one is his Body by Nature,</hi> and the other <hi>his Body by Inſtitution;</hi> that the former is the <hi>matter of his humane ſubſtance, without perſonal ſubſiſtence,</hi> and the other, a <hi>matter choſen,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>the ſubſtance of Bread, not having hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Features;</hi> that the one is holy, becauſe it is Deified; that the other is rendred holy <hi>by the Sanctification of Grace;</hi> in fine, That the one is his Fleſh which he hath taken to himſelf, and that he hath ſanctified with a holineſs proper unto himſelf; and that the other is ſanctified by the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt, which by the Miniſtry of the Prieſt makes it holy, whereas it was common. And becauſe the Fathers which preceded them were wont to conſider the Sacrament as an Image of the Son of God; theſe alſo will have it to be an expreſs Image of this adorable Myſtery; in contemplation whereof, we muſt lift up our Faith, and bring down our Sins; its for this reaſon they ſay, <hi>That there's no other thing under Heaven, nor any other Figure but that, choſen by Jeſus Chriſt to expreſs the Image of his Incarnation;</hi> and a little under they ſay, That our Saviour's deſign in the Inſtitution of the Sacrament, was to repreſent and ſhew clearly unto Men the Myſtery of his Oeconomy; that is to ſay, of his Incarnation: therefore they thus conclude all their Diſcourſe, <hi>It hath been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated that it is the true Figure of the Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt our God.</hi> If it be a true Image, as they do aſſure, it is neceſſary ſay ſome, that the ſubſtance of Bread ſhould remain after Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, to repreſent ſincerely the truth of the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, the which is not aboliſhed by his Union unto the Divine Nature; they add unto all theſe conſiderations, that the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil teſtifies, that our Lord commanded us to make, not his real Body, but the Figure of his Body and of his Blood; and in that Jeſus Chriſt commanded that this Image ſhould be of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Bread, without the lineaments of humane ſhape, it was to prevent Idolatry: An Argument which would be unworthy the Council, if it had believed that the Bread after Conſecrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had been no longer Bread, but the Body it ſelf of the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our of the World, which ought to be Religiouſly adored, by reaſon of his perſonal Union with the Godhead; very far from fearing of committing Idolatry in adoring of him. Thus it is that many do argue from this teſtimony.</p>
                  <p>They lived thirty two years in the Eaſt under the Authority of this Council, but in the year 787. the Empreſs <hi>Irene</hi> having a violent affection for Images, cauſed a ſecond Council to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled

In this Council, aſſembled at the deſire and pleaſure of the Empreſs, who governed all things in the Minority of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> her Son, was diſannull'd all that had been done at <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> againſt Images; and by the way, they cenſured what the other Fathers had ſaid, That the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is an Image of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe, ſaid they, it is his true Body, and his true Blood, and not an Image:

But in that of <hi>Nice,</hi> I am obliged to ſay that there is Injuſtice to be found, in that theſe Prelates do aſſure in a great many places, that they had preſent in their Aſſembly the Legats of the three Patriarchs of the Eaſt; whereas the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain truth is,
<note place="margin">Conc. Nican 2. act. 3. p. 594, 595, 596, 597.</note> that not one of the three Patriarchs of the Eaſt did ſend any Deputies thither; but five or ſix Hermits of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> ignorant and unexperienced perſons, as they call themſelves, at the inſtance of the Deputies of the Patriarch <hi>Terraſius,</hi> did depute two of their own number, <hi>John</hi> and <hi>Thomas,</hi> to aſſiſt at this Council; of the Legates of the Patriarchs of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> of <hi>Antioch,</hi> and of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I find no marks or mention; the pieces inſerted in the Acts of the Council teſtifie the ſame. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, in the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the Fathers whereof it was compoſed, did not licentiouſly abuſe the holy Scriptures to draw it to their party; but I cannot forbear ſaying, that it was quite otherwiſe in that of <hi>Nice,</hi> where they took liberty miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:47504:191"/>to wreſt the Scriptures, and to corrupt them to draw in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences in favour of Image Worſhip, this is to be ſeen in ſeveral inſtances, eſpecially in all the fourth Seſſion. In the third place, we do not ſee that the Fathers of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had recourſe to ſo many and groſs pieces as thoſe of <hi>Nice,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 2. p. 555. Act. 4. p. 622.</note> who made uſe of them freely, and without any ſcruple, for the eſtabliſhing of their Opinion; as the Acts of Pope <hi>Sylveſter</hi> in the ſecond Seſſion; the Book of the Paſſion of an Image of Jeſus Chriſt, under the name of St. <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> although this ridiculous piece had been but newly invented,
<note place="margin">Ibid. 642. Ibid. 649.</note> no queſtion but by ſome one that was for Worſhipping of Images; the obſcene and filthy Hiſtory of a Friar tempted by the Spirit of Fornication, which they attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted unto <hi>Sophronius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and a Letter of St. <hi>Baſil</hi> unto the Emperor <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate, wherein this holy Doctor acknowledgeth and embraceth the Worſhip of Images, a piece alſo invented by ſome ignorant Impoſtor; all this in the 4th Seſſion. Therefore it is very judiciouſly obſerved in the Books of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> that thoſe of <hi>Nice,</hi> ſeeing the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures would not accord with their Errors, they had recourſe unto I know not what humane Fooleries, worthy of ſhame. I'le ſay nothing of their denying the Epiſtle produced under the name of <hi>Ibas</hi> to be truly his,
<note place="margin">Act. 6. p. 775.</note> againſt the teſtimony of the Acts of the Council of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> and the very confeſſion of <hi>Ibas</hi> himſelf. In fine, it is found that the Fathers of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> have very faithfully retained the Doctrine and Expreſſions of thoſe unto whom God had committed the conduct of the Church before them, for they call the Euchariſt an Image, Type, Commemorati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it is the common Language of the Ancients; they teach, that it is Bread, the ſubſtance of Bread; the Ancients had ſaid ſo before them, as hath been amply related in the ſecond Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of this part of our Hiſtory: they call it the Body of Jeſus Chriſt by Inſtitution, which amounts unto what their Anceſtors ſaid, that it is the Typical, the Myſtical, the Symbolical Body, the Body by Grace, as hath been declared; and they alſo agree with them, when they ſay that the Sacrament is the Image of his Incarnation. But as for the Fathers of <hi>Nice,</hi> it is ſaid, that if they abſolutely departed not from the Doctrine of the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents, they did at leaſt from their terms and expreſſions, when they denied that the Fathers had called the Bread and Wine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Conſecration, Types, or Figures; which appeared ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent unto thoſe which have given us the Councils, that they could not forbear reproving this confidence by this Annotation, which they have ſet in the Margin; the Greek Fathers often call the things Sanctified, Figures, as <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> in the Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:47504:191"/>Oration of his Siſter, and in his firſt <hi>Appologetick; Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in his 5th <hi>Myſtagogical Catechiſm,</hi> and others. The Abbot of <hi>Billy</hi> hath alſo blamed, as hath been before declared, the like temerity in <hi>Damaſcen;</hi> and certainly with much reaſon, ſeeing there is nothing more frequent in the Writings of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, than theſe kind of expreſſions; yet it was upon this falſe ground that theſe Prelates of <hi>Nice</hi> founded their cenſure againſt thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> which had called the Euchariſt the Image of the Body of Jeſus Ghriſt, and that on the contrary they ſaid, <hi>That it is his Body it ſelf.</hi> Words which the <hi>Latins</hi> are wont to explain to their advantage, although the Proteſtants do not judge that in the main of the Doctrine, <hi>Nice</hi> was not Diametri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally oppoſite unto <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> to underſtand it aright, it muſt be remembred, the chief occaſion of aſſembling both Councils, was the ſubject of Images, the Council of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> having aboliſhed the Uſe and Worſhip of them; And that of <hi>Nice</hi> having reſtored both the one and the other; it muſt alſo be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred, that the Fathers of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> taking from the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt a proof againſt the Uſe and Worſhip of Images, they called the Sacrament an Image, and declared, that it was the only Image which Chriſt commanded to be made; But becauſe the word Image doth at the firſt hearing, form in the mind the Idea of a proper Image and ſimple Picture, that hath no other uſe nor propriety then to repreſent unto our Eyes ſome form like the Original, without any way participating of its Operation and Virtue: (in a word, a Picture, like to thoſe which be ſold in Painters Shops) the Prelates of <hi>Nice</hi> thinking thoſe of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople</hi> had in this ſenſe given the name of Image unto the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, as Cardinal <hi>Beſſarion</hi> told us <hi>Damaſcen</hi> had done, failed not ſeverely to cenſure them; not but that the Fathers of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had ſufficiently enough explained themſelves in ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that this Image, to wit, the Divine Bread, is filled with the Holy Ghoſt. But in fine, the Prelates of <hi>Nice,</hi> either through Paſſion to their Adverſaries, or otherwiſe; for 'tis not for me to judge of their thoughts, reflected ſharply upon thoſe of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> thinking they had taken this term of Image in the ſenſe as we have expreſſed; ſeveral things made them think ſo: In the firſt place they tell us themſelves, that it was their thought; and that they gave no other ſignification to the word Image; <hi>As for the Image,</hi> ſay they,
<note place="margin">Concil. Nicaen. 2. act. 6. tom. 6. p. 800. t. 5. Concil. Ibid. p. 799.</note> 
                     <hi>we know no other but that it is an Image which ſheweth the reſemblance of its Original, whence alſo it is that it takes the name, and that it hath nothing elſe common with it;</hi> A little before they had ſaid, <hi>That what the Image hath in common with the Original, is the name only, and not the definition;</hi> And
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:47504:192"/>again in another place,
<note place="margin">Ibid. t. 3. p. 353</note> 
                     <hi>One thing is the Image, and another thing is the Original; and a man of ſenſe will never ſeek the Proprieties of the Original in the Image.</hi> Secondly, <hi>Elias</hi> of <hi>Creet,</hi> now <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia,</hi> one of the Fathers of the Council ſheweth they think very clearly, that the intent of the Council was not to teach, that the Bread and the Wine were changed into the ſubſtance of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, but only into their Efficacy and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; for uſing the words of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria</hi> before al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged,
<note place="margin">Elias Cretenſ. in Orat. 1. Greg. Nazianz p. 201.</note> he ſaith, <hi>That God doth ſend into the things offered an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livening vertue, and that he makes them to paſs into the operation of his Fleſh;</hi> it is in the Greek of St. <hi>Cyril, into the Efficacy of his Fleſh:</hi> There is yet more, the Fathers of <hi>Nice</hi> being in a hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of reproving and cenſuring thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as to whatever with any weak ſhew might fall within the compaſs of their cenſure, it is no force to conceive, that they approved what they have not blamed; and that they have owned as Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick and Orthodox the things which they have not cenſured. They ſay, that all reaſonable perſons will grant, if they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how the Biſhops of <hi>Nice</hi> were affected towards them of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> whoſe Conſtitutions and Decrees they publickly revoked; now of two things inſiſted upon by theſe latter, the Prelates of <hi>Nice</hi> cenſured but one, they muſt then approve of the other; and in approving, they muſt receive it as Catholick, and as one of the Articles of their Belief. The Fathers of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinople</hi> had ſaid, that the Euchariſt is the Image of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; but they ſaid alſo, That this Image is the ſubſtance of Bread; here are Adverſaries eagerly bent againſt them. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries that ſpare them not in any thing, that ſtrictly examine every thing they do or ſay, either to render them odious, or to make them be eſteemed Wicked and Villains; there's no like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood then they would have ſpared them, if they had departed from the Belief publickly received in the Church, ſeeing they had taken the liberty of cenſuring them for uſing the terms and expreſſions which their Forefathers had been accuſtomed to uſe in the like occaſions. In fine, of two things that <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> had aſſerted, <hi>Nice</hi> doth cenſure one, and not the other, it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns the former, and not the latter: The firſt doth diſguſt it, the ſecond doth not; although the one regards but the terms, and the other ingageth directly the ground of the Doctrine it ſelf; it will not permit it ſhould be ſaid, that the Euchariſt is the Image of Jeſus Chriſt; but it will have it ſaid. That it is the ſubſtance of Bread after Conſecration. Let us, for example, put inſtead of that of <hi>Nice,</hi> a Council of the Latin Church; and inſtead of that of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> a Proteſtant Council; who
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:47504:192"/>could imagine, that the Council of the Latin Church ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn that of the Proteſtants, for ſaying, <hi>That the Euchariſt is the Image of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> and that it ſhould not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it for affirming, <hi>That it is the ſubſtance of Bread even after Conſecration;</hi> Nevertheleſs this is juſt what is done by the Fathers of <hi>Nice.</hi> Is not there then abſolute neceſſity to conclude, That <hi>Nice</hi> was of Accord with <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> as to what concerned the Doctrine, and that neither the one nor the other, departed from the Ancient Belief of the Church; this at leaſt is what is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred: But may the Latins ſay, the Prelates of <hi>Nice</hi> ſay, that the Euchariſt is <hi>properly called the Body of Chriſt, and that it is ſo.</hi> The Proteſtants anſwer, it cannot be thought ſtrange in the thoughts they had that the Biſhops of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> meant that it was an Image that had nothing common with its Original, but the Name only; an Image that participated not of its vertue, and that was deſtitute of any efficacy; and to ſay the truth, ſay theſe latter, the Sacrament being impregnated, if it may be ſo ſaid, with the Grace and Benediction of our Saviour, filled with his Vertue and Efficacy, cloathed with the Majeſty of his own Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, accompanied with all the fruits and advantages of his death, nothing may hinder from ſaying, That it is his Body, becauſe it enjoys the priviledges; and that there is ſeen, in the lawful uſe of this Copy, the ſame Vertue and the ſame Efficacy as that which reſides in its Prototype and in its Original, with the which it is by conſequence, in a manner, one and the ſame; for then eſpecially is true what <hi>Euſebius</hi> ſaid,

                  <p>Seven years after, to wit, in the year 794. <hi>Charlemain</hi> being diſpleaſed at what had been done at <hi>Nice</hi> in favour of Images, cauſed a Council to be aſſembled at <hi>Francfort</hi> to prohibit the Worſhip, and ſtop the progreſs of an abuſe which then ſeemed intolerable unto the greateſt number of Chriſtians in the Weſt: And at this time were written the Books of Images which bear the name of this Emperor, becauſe in all likelihood they were written by his order, rather than by his Pen. In one of theſe Books is cenſured the word Image or likeneſs, as thoſe of <hi>Nice</hi> had cenſured it in thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> I will not now examine if there was any thing of ſurpriſe in this Cenſure, that is, if it was done with an intent of directing it againſt <hi>Nice,</hi> and not againſt
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:47504:193"/>thoſe of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> for although it is moſt certain that the principal deſign of the Council of <hi>Francfort</hi> was to oppoſe that of <hi>Nice,</hi> againſt whom thoſe of the Weſt were no leſs incenſed, than thoſe of <hi>Nice</hi> had been againſt them of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> I will make no cenſure upon the matter, not to give occaſion unto any uncharitable Reader of cenſuring me. It ſhall ſuffice to cite the words of the Book,
<note place="margin">Carol.

                  </p>
                  <p>It is no hard matter to gueſs at the ſcope of theſe words, and to ſee that they do not tend to the condemning the word Image, taking it for a holy Sign, inſtituted of God not only to ſignifie and repreſent, but alſo effectually to communicate Jeſus Chriſt unto our Souls, dead for our ſins; their intent is only to reprove this term, as it was taken for a legal Shadow, or for a prefiguration of Chriſt to come; therefore to ſhew that the Sacrament was not of the Nature of Types and Figures of the Law, which did only repreſent, without communicating the thing repreſented; it is ſpoken in oppoſition unto the Sacrifices of Beaſts, that our Saviour hath left us, not his Body <hi>but the Sacrament of his Body and of his Blood;</hi> but a Sacrament ſo efficacious and Divine, that the faithful Soul never participates of it, but that it really and truly communicates of the thing it ſelf; whereas the Types of the Law did only prefigure it; therefore it is that the Author ſaid a little before,

                     <hi>That it is the Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator of God and Men, which by the Miniſtry of the Prieſt, and the Innovation of the name of God, doth make the Sacrament of his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood, which he hath left us for a Commemoration of his Death and of our Salvation:</hi> And again, <hi>The Apoſtle</hi> St. <hi>Paul,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that choſen Veſſel, conſidering that the Body and Blood of our Lord ſhould not only be equal unto all other Sacraments, but alſo preferable unto any,</hi> he

Neither will I infiſt upon a Confeſſion of Faith, which Father <hi>Chifflet</hi> hath publiſhed in the name of the famous <hi>Alcuin,</hi> becauſe it is no leſs Fathered upon this excellent Maſter of <hi>Charlemain,</hi> than the Book of Divine Offices: And that it is moſt certain, it was taken out of the Books of <hi>Anſelm</hi>'s Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations, and unadviſedly crowded into the Works of St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> Now <hi>Anſelm</hi> lived towards the end of the XI.

And I could eaſily here inſert all the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent proofs of Forgery which the piece it ſelf doth furniſh; but becauſe it is ſo apparent a truth, and that moreover I find it hath already been done, I will proceed to the conſideration of what is found in the genuine works of <hi>Alcuin</hi> touching the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in hand. In one of his Letters he ſaith of the Bread and
<pb n="383" facs="tcp:47504:194"/>Wine of the Sacrament, that they be conſecrated, <hi>in Corpus &amp; Sanguinem Chriſti,</hi> into the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. But let us hear the Explication he gives unto us of theſe words in the ſame place:
<note place="margin">Alcuin. Ep. 59.</note> 
                     <hi>The Sanctification</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of this Myſtery doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage the effect of our Salvation: The faithful people is underſtood by the Water; and by the Grains of Wheat whereof the Flower is taken to make the Bread, is meant the Union of the whole Church, which is baked into one body by the fire of the Holy Ghoſt, to the end the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſhould be united unto their Head,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And by the Wine, the Blood of the Paſſion of our Lord is exhibited: and ſo when in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, the Water is mingled with the Flower and the Wine, the faithful People is incorporated and joyned unto Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the ſteps of St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> from whence he borrowed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion.

<note place="margin">Id. in Joan. l. 5. c. 28.</note> 
                     <hi>He was</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to continue but a little time corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally with his Church; but as for the Poor, they were to remain al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways; ſo that we might always give unto them.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. l. 6. c. 34, &amp; 35.</note> And in the ſame Treatiſe, <hi>If I depart by the abſence of my Body, I will come by the preſence of my Divinity, whereby I will be with you unto the end of the World.</hi> And again, in the ſenſe of venerable <hi>Bede:
<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 37.</note> It is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that I ſhould remove from before your eyes the form of a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, to the end that the love of the Divinity might ſink deeper into your hearts. It is neceſſary I ſhould carry into Heaven this Form which is known unto you, to the end you ſhould the more ardently deſire to be in that place.</hi> And according to what St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaid in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 6th. Chapter of St. <hi>John; Whoſoever eateth my fleſh,
<note place="margin">Ibid. l. 3. c. 15.</note> and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him. This eating</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>his Fleſh, and drinking his Blood, is to dwell in Jeſus Chriſt, and to have Jeſus Chriſt dwelling in us: And ſo he that dwelleth not in Jeſus Chriſt, and in whom Jeſus Chriſt dwelleth not, for certain, eateth not ſpiritually the Fleſh, although he viſibly and carnally doth eat the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Chriſt; but rather, he eateth and drinketh unto his Condemnation the Sacrament of ſo great a thing; becauſe, being impure, he preſumed to come to the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Jeſus Chriſt, which none receive worthily but thoſe that are holy.</hi> After all this, let it be judged which ſide <hi>Alcuin</hi> was of. Although the Book called the <hi>Roman Order</hi> is not of any certain date, and that the Learned do not agree at what time it firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared: Nevertheleſs, becauſe there be ſome that judge that it was written about the time that the Books of Images were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed under the name of <hi>Charlemain;</hi> but they are deceived,
<note place="margin">Ord. Rom. de Offic. Miſſ. t. 10 Bibl. Pat. ed. 4. p. 5.</note> the Author being much younger. We will make no difficulty of joyning it unto what we have alledged of thoſe Books, and of the Works of <hi>Alcuin. The Sub-Deacons</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>having ſeen the

And again,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> in the ſame place; <hi>The Biſhop breaketh the Oblation; that is to ſay, the Bread, on the right ſide, and leaves the piece he broke upon the Altar.</hi> He ſpeaks of a Subject that may be broken into bits and pieces.
<note place="margin">Ibid p. 6.</note> And in the following Page, <hi>The Fraction, or</hi> as 'tis read in the Margin, <hi>the Conſecration, being done, the young<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of the Deacons, taking the pattern from the Sub-Deacon, carries it unto the place where the Biſhop is, to the end he may communicate; and having communicated, he delivers unto the Arch-Deacon, the holy Hoſt which he had bit.</hi> See again, if the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt could be bit; and if it could be ſaid of the real Blood of Jeſus Chriſt what he obſerves in the ſame place,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note>

In fine,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> he will have the Deacon take care with much precaution, that there be nothing left remaining in the Cup and Plate of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. <q>Is it to to be conceived (ſay the Proteſtants) that any drop of the Blood of our Saviour could remain in the Cup; or any part of his glorified Body in the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten?</q> In the <hi>Roman Order</hi> of thoſe times, which this Author af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward relates, there is to be read what we have alledged of the Cannon of the Maſs in the 8th Chapter of the firſt Part.

                     <hi>Paſchas Radbert</hi> a Friar of <hi>Corby</hi> near <hi>Amiens,</hi> yet bolder than <hi>Anaſtatius</hi> of Mount <hi>Sina,</hi> who contented himſelf in giving an aſſault unto the ancient manner of Expreſſions, about the year 818. attacked the Doctrine it ſelf; the Providence of God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting that the Innovations which aroſe in the terms, and in the belief, took beginning by two Friars; which being both of them incloſed in their Cloiſters, departed in their meditations, the one from the Expreſſions, the other from the Belief of their Anceſtors. I ſaid that <hi>Paſchas</hi> began to write of this matter in the year 818. becauſe it was in that year he compoſed his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe of the Body and Blood of the Lord, as may be collected from the Preface to his Scholar <hi>Placidus;</hi> where ſpeaking unto <hi>Adelard</hi> his Abbot, under the name of one <hi>Arſenius</hi> an old Hermit, he ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently ſhews, that he wrote in the year that <hi>Bernard</hi> King of <hi>Italy,</hi> and ſome others, had their eyes put out for conſpiring againſt <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debonaire;</hi> and that ſome Biſhops that were of the ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bination were baniſh'd and depos'd; which hapned exactly in the year 818. the Rebellion having begun in the year 817. as the Hiſtorians of thoſe times inform us. I will not mention that <hi>Paſchas</hi> appears ſometimes to be diſturbed at what may happen in going about to adjuſt ſome ancient expreſſions with his new Opinion, to make his diſguiſe ſucceed the better: He proceeded by way of Explication; it ſhall ſuffice to ſay, that it ſeems it may be ſo gathered from the words of his Letter unto <hi>Frudegard, Although</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I have writ nothing in this Book,

But <hi>Dom Luke d'Achery</hi> a Benedictine Friar, hath informed us by the help of Manuſcripts, that <hi>Paſchas</hi> was the true Author of them. In theſe two Books he teacheth, that the bleſſed Virgin was Delivered after an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary and miraculous manner; and that Jeſus Chriſt was not born after the common courſe of Nature; but that he came out of the Womb of this bleſſed Maid without any opening, and not as <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaith in ſome of his Writings, <hi>Lege pate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facti Corporis:</hi> But as <hi>Bertram</hi> or <hi>Ratramn</hi> refuted the ground of the Doctrine of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> ſo he alſo refuted this progreſs of it, by a little Treatiſe he wrote on purpoſe, on the Birth of Jeſus Chriſt; wherein ſeveral times he qualifies with the name of Hereſie, the Opinion which he refutes; whereas I do not find that he ever gave this name unto what his Adverſary had taught of the Sacrament; which gives me occaſion to make this conjecture, which I freely ſubmit unto the Reader's Judgment; to wit, That <hi>Paſchas</hi> having proceeded in what he wrote of the Sacrament by way of Explication; and as one that did ſeek for the true knowledge of this Myſtery: His Adverſaries did not call this Doctrine Hereſie, how erroneous ſoever they knew him to be in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Century were more conſiderable, and of greater numbers than his Adverſaries, the Opinion of the Latin Church had the victory over the other; but if alſo the number of his Adverſaries was greater, their
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:47504:197"/>Name more famous, and their Reputation better eſtabliſhed; it muſt be concluded, That the Belief of the Proteſtants had the Victory; it appears that ſo things are to be underſtood, to do right unto both parties:</p>
                  <p>The better to ſucceed in this deſign, I will begin with thoſe that followed <hi>Paſchas;</hi> ſeeing it was him that obliged his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries to contradict him, and oppoſe themſelves unto the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of his Opinion; which appeared new unto them, and different from the ancient Faith of the Church. It cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied but <hi>Paſchas Radbert</hi> had good Endowments, as appears by his Works; and that he was commended by ſome Writers of that time, as a Man of great Learning, and above the common ſort. Nevertheleſs, as to the Subject in hand, I have not obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in what I have read, that many perſons have declared in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of him. It is out of all queſtion that <hi>Frudegard</hi> fell into his Opinion, after having read his Treatiſe of the Body and Blood of Chriſt: for in the Letter which <hi>Paſchas</hi> writ him,
<note place="margin">Paſchaſ. Ep. ad Frudeg. pag. 1620.</note> we therein find theſe words; <hi>You ſay that you believed ſo formerly</hi> (he ſpeaks of his Opinion) <hi>and that you read the ſame in the Book of Sacraments that I compoſed.</hi> Since which time, <hi>Frudegard</hi> having read the Advertiſement which St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> gives in the third Book of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Doctrine, of underſtanding figuratively what our Saviour ſpeaks of eating his Fleſh, he was very much ſhaken; and if he changed not quite, it may be ſaid, that he continued in ſuſpence, without declaring for or againſt <hi>Paſchas.</hi> It is what he informs us,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> when he adds unto his firſt words; <hi>But you ſay that you have ſince read in St.</hi> Auſtin<hi>'s third Book of Chriſtian Doctrine, that where it is ſaid, it is the body and blood of Chriſt, it is a figurative manner of expreſſion: and if it is a figurative ſpeech, and a figure rather than the truth; I cannot tell, ſay you, how it ſhould be underſtood. And you ſay afterwards, And if I believe that it is the ſame body as that which he took from the holy Virgin his Mother, this excellent Doctor</hi> (that is to ſay, St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) <hi>declares on the contrary, that it is a great crime; to wit, to believe that it is the real body of Jeſus Chriſt. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas</hi> doth what he can to continue him in the Opinion he had been of, before he had read this paſſage of St. <hi>Auſtin;</hi> and the better to effect it, he alledges this unto him under the name of this great Saint, and as being taken out of his Sermons unto the <hi>Neophites;

<pb n="390" facs="tcp:47504:198"/>to ſay, <hi>As I remember;</hi> or, <hi>If my memory fail not.</hi> In the main, it not appearing that he ſatisfied <hi>Frudegard</hi> in his doubts, the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt ſide we can take in this Conjuncture is, to make him neither a Friend, nor an Adverſary of <hi>Paſchas;</hi> but to leave him in his doubts, if we would not increaſe the Sect of Scepticks. I will not ſay the ſame of the Anonymous Author, which Father <hi>Cellot</hi> hath furniſhed us, and whom we have twice mentioned al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in this Chapter: for it appears plainly he was on <hi>Paſchas</hi> his ſide. I know not preciſely the time that he lived; although it is very probable, it was either at the latter end of the IX.

<pb n="391" facs="tcp:47504:198"/>ſay, that I do not find that he was of any extraordinary eſteem: for if we believe Father <hi>Sirmond,</hi> who otherwiſe was no Enemy unto him: <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> Hincmar <hi>was wont to be deceived himſelf,
<note place="margin">Sirm. de duob. Dionyſ. c. 4. Mauguin. Hiſt. Chron. p. 442.

And if we will give Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit unto the deſcription that is made of him in the Apologies of the holy Fathers, Defenders of Free Will, we ſhall find him to be both violent and ignorant; a Deceiver, ſcandalous and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; a Calumniator, and a Man full of Vanity. Theſe are the Colours wherein he is diſplayed in that excellent Work; beſides ſeveral others which I paſs over in ſilence. So that if <hi>Hincmar</hi> was ſuch a perſon as theſe Gentlemen deſcribe him to be, I do not think he would render the Party very conſiderable, in which ſide ſoever he is placed: yet he cannot be denied the Knowledge of the ancient Canons, if I miſtake not, wherein he was better skill'd, than in that which is dogmatical, and relating unto Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>In the main, ſee here two Followers of <hi>Paſchas;</hi> one of which, to wit, the <hi>Anonymous,</hi> declares himſelf directly for him; and the other, I mean <hi>Hincmar,</hi> though he makes not ſo formal a Declaration, doth nevertheleſs in all probability follow his ſteps. But in fine, they are the only two which I can find to be of the Belief of <hi>Paſchas</hi> in the IX Century, if it were true that the Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous wrote in that Century; whereas if he wrote after, as Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Cellot</hi> inclines to think he did, all the ſtrength of this Friar, and afterwards Abbot of <hi>Corby,</hi> will conſiſt in himſelf and <hi>Hinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar,</hi> in the uncertainty we are in, whether St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> or <hi>Paſchas</hi> prevailed over <hi>Frudegard.</hi> As for the Author of the Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries upon St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles, which ſome attribute unto <hi>Hay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alberſtadt,</hi> others unto <hi>Remy</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Lyons;</hi> and others, in fine, with greater probability, unto <hi>Remy</hi> Friar of <hi>Auxerr;</hi> I do not think he ought to be reckoned amongſt the Friends nor Enemies of <hi>Paſchas:</hi> He did like thoſe that ſeeing a Kingdom divided into two Factions, take part with neither; but think of making a third Party: for he would neither follow the Party of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> nor the Belief of thoſe which argued againſt him; but would eſtabliſh in the Weſt, as far as I can find, the Opinion that <hi>Damaſcen</hi> had broached in the Eaſt, of the Union of the Bread of the Sacrament with the Divinity, to make by means of this Union, one ſole Body with the true Body of our Saviour, as we have ſhewed in ſpeaking of <hi>Damaſcen.</hi> And this is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that we here place <hi>Remy</hi> of <hi>Auxerr,</hi> although he lived not, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to all Circumſtances, but at the end of the IX Century: and to ſay the truth, becauſe he had a middle Opinion betwixt
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:47504:199"/>that of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> and that of his Adverſaries, we cannot appoint him a fitter place than this; to the end, that as he diſturbed not the Depoſitions of <hi>Paſchas</hi> his Friends, neither ſhould he trouble the Teſtimony of his Adverſaries. That the Opinion of <hi>Remy</hi> is ſuch as we ſay, I hope the Candid Reader will believe it to be ſo, when he ſhall ſee what we here produce of his Commentaries upon the 10th and 11th Chapters of the Firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and of his Expoſition of the Cannon of the Maſs, 'The Fleſh <hi>(ſaith he)</hi>

<pb n="393" facs="tcp:47504:199"/>and joyning of two different ſubjects, preſuppoſeth the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of the one and the other; he ſaith alſo, that the Church as well as the Sacrament, is one Body with the natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt; he affirms it no more of the Sacrament than of the Church; he then meant that they were both ſo, after one and the ſame manner. In fine, ſee here how he argues; the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the Sacrament, and the Church, are filled with one and the ſame vertue, and animated, if it may be ſo ſaid, with the ſame Spirit; they are not then three Bodies, but one; the Unity of one Body depending on the unity of the Principle that acts in him. So that becauſe the ſame Principle that acts in the natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt, acts alſo in the Bread of the Euchariſt, and in the Church, they ſhould not be, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to this Author, but one and the ſame Body: becauſe that, though conſidering them ſeverally, they be three different Bodies; yet to conſider them in the unity of this Principle, and in the Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merical Identity, if I may ſo ſay, of the ſame vertue, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come one ſole Body.

This Letter is loſt, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther through the length of time, or the malice of Men which have lived ſince that time. But 'tis ſufficient that we do know that he wrote it; and by conſequence, was a great Enemy of <hi>Paſchas;</hi> as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>he plainly teſtifies by ſeveral of his other Works, which are come to our hands; for he teacheth that the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine remain after Conſecration; and that theſe divine Symbols being received by Communicants, part of it turns into their ſubſtance, and the reſt goes as their other ordinary food doth, unto the place where Nature diſchargeth it ſelf.

                     <hi>Thomas Waldenſis</hi> teſtifies the ſame in divers parts of his Writings; where he reproacheth <hi>Wicliff, That as he teacheth that the Euchariſt is digeſted, and paſſeth into our ſubſtance; ſo he might alſo teach, with</hi> Rabanus, <hi>that it paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth into the draft.</hi> And he inſtanceth the very Teſtimonies which <hi>Wicliff</hi> had borrowed out of <hi>Rabanus,</hi> for the defence of his Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. It is then moſt certain that this Archbiſhop of <hi>Mayans</hi> taught two things of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt; one that by reaſon of its ſubſtance and matter, it was ſubject unto the meaneſt accidents of our ordinary food: and in ſo ſaying, he followed the Opinion of <hi>Origin;</hi> who ſaid ſo poſitively, ſix hundred years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him. The other thing which he taught is, That the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment doth feed our body, and turns it ſelf into our ſubſtance; which he learned from St. <hi>Irenaeus,</hi> St. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> St. <hi>Iſidore</hi> of <hi>Sevil,</hi> and others. But let us hear what he intends himſelf to ſay unto us.

                     <hi>Our Saviour</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>choſe rather that believers ſhould receive with the mouth the Sacraments of his Body and Blood, and that it ſhould be converted into their nouriſhment</hi> (or as it
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:47504:200"/>is cited by <hi>Thomas Waldenſis,</hi> agreeable to the Manuſcript Copies) <hi>into part of themſelves; to the end that by the viſible thing, the invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible effect ſhould be ſhewn: for as material food doth nouriſh the body, and preſerve it outwardly; ſo in like manner the Word doth inward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtrengthen and preſerve the ſoul.</hi> And again;
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>the Sacrament is one thing, and the vertue of the Sacrament is another: The Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is converted into the nouriſhment of the body, but by the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Sacrament we do acquire Eternal Life. As then the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is converted into us, when we do eat and drink it, ſo alſo are we converted into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, when we do live in Obedience, and in Holineſs.</hi> And building always upon this Foundation,
<note place="margin">Id. in Mat. c. 26</note> he ſaith elſewhere, with venerable <hi>Bede; That Jeſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Id. in Eccleſia. li. 7. c. 8.</note> in the room of the Paſchal Lamb, hath ſubſtituted the Sacrament of his Body and Blood. That the Creator of the World,

That the Unlevened Bread and Wine mixed with Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, are ſanctified to be the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Then he gives the reaſon wherefore our Lord choſe Bread and Wine to be made the Sacraments of his Body and Blood; and ſaith, <hi>That it is becauſe</hi> Melchiſedek <hi>did offer Bread and Wine;
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and that Jeſus Chriſt being a Prieſt after the Order of</hi> Melchiſedek, <hi>he ought to imitate his Oblation.</hi> And teaching us wherefore the Sacrament takes the name of the Body and Blood of our Saviour, he ſaith, with <hi>Iſidore</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Sevill,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Becauſe bread doth ſtrengthen the body, it is fitly called the Body of Jeſus Chriſt: and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Wine increaſeth blood in the body, it doth for this cauſe reſemble his Blood.</hi> Now both theſe are viſible; yet nevertheleſs,
<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 33.</note> being ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, they paſs into a Sacrament of the Divine Body: a Sacrament which he calls the Myſtical Body of Jeſus Chriſt, by oppoſition unto his natural Body, from which he diſtinguiſheth it.

                  <p>After <hi>Rabanus,</hi> I will receive the Depoſition of <hi>Amalarius For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunatus,</hi> although a little ancienter.

                     <note place="margin">Amalar. in Prolog.

                     <hi>The Biſhops</hi> Halitgarius <hi>and</hi> Amalarius <hi>are come unto me,</hi> &amp;c. Let us conclude then from what hath been ſaid, that <hi>Amalarius</hi> was, in his time, in Eſteem and great Conſideration in Church and State.
<note place="margin">Amalar. de Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fic. Eccleſ. l. 1. c. 1.</note> And now let us examine what he ſaid of the Sacrament, directly or indirectly. <hi>After</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that our Saviour had appeared according to his own pleaſure unto his Diſciples, whom he would have to be Witneſſes of his Reſurrection, he aſcended up into Heaven, and became inviſible unto Men; as he himſelf teſtifies:</hi> I came forth from the Father, and came into the World; and now I leave the World, and go unto the Father. <hi>Which is plainly to ſay,</hi> I made my ſelf viſible unto men; return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto my Father, I ſhall be inviſible. <hi>Although we do not ſee his bodily preſence, yet we daily ſalute him in adoring of him.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Id. de Ordine Antiphon. c. 9.</note> And elſwhere, <hi>We cannot think of the abſence of Jeſus Chriſt without ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> But what he is going to tell us is yet more plain and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive,
<note place="margin">Id. de Offic. l. 3. c. 29.</note> becauſe he teſtifies that Bread and Wine is conſecrated and made the Sacraments of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>We</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>call Inſtitution the Tradition which our Saviour left us, when he made the Sacrament of his Body and Blood.</hi> And to the end it ſhould be known what he meant by the word Sacrament, he gives us this Definition of it; <hi>Sacrament, that is, a holy Sign.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Id. l. 1. c. 15.</note> He ſaith moreover, that the Sacrament is in the ſtead of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>The Prieſt bows, and recommends unto God the Father that which was offered in the place of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Id. l. 3. c. 23.</note> He diſtinguiſheth what was ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed from Jeſus Chriſt himſelf; and conſiders what is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and Jeſus Chriſt, as two different Subjects; whereof the one ſerves us inſtead of the other;
<note place="margin">Id. l. 3. c. 25.</note> for it cannot be conceived that a perſon or a thing can be inſtead of it ſelf. He yet goes farther, and declares expreſly, that that which is offered inſtead of Jeſus Chriſt is Bread and Wine;

The Sacraments ſhould have ſome reſemblance of the things whereof they be Sacraments. Let the Prieſt then be like Jeſus Chriſt, as the Bread and the Liquor is like the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Theſe words are eaſie to be underſtood, and need no Commentary; becauſe eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body may perceive, without help of others, that <hi>Amalarius</hi> conſiders the Act of the Sacrament as a myſterious Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:47504:202"/>where the Prieſt celebrating, is in the place of Jeſus Chriſt; the Bread, Wine and Water inſtead of his Body and Blood, and will have a Relation of Reſemblance to be betwixt theſe things, and thoſe whereof they be Sacraments; which according to ſome, is plainly contrary unto the Identity taught by <hi>Paſchas.

                     <hi>The Bread ſet forth upon the Altar ſignifies the Body of our Lord upon the Croſs, the Wine and Water in the Cup do repreſent the Sacraments which flowed out of our Saviours ſide upon the Croſs.</hi> He calls the Euchariſt the Sacrament of Bread and Wine; and ſaith, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt in the Bread recommended his Body, and his Blood in the Cup.</hi> And with <hi>Bede, that the Apoſtle recommends the Unity of the Church in the Sacrament of Bread.</hi> He obſerves the Bread is put into the Wine.
<note place="margin">Ibid. l. 1. c. 15.</note> And in the paſſage which gave occaſion of the Cenſure of <hi>Paſchas</hi> and of <hi>Florus,</hi> he ſpeaks of what is received in Communicating, as of a thing bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken into ſeveral peices. In fine, he affirms that Jeſus Chriſt did drink Wine in his Sacrament. <hi>Our Saviour ſaid,</hi> I will no more drink of this Fruit of the Vine, until I drink it new with you; <hi>which the Leſſon read the ſecond Sunday after the Reſurrection of our Lord, ſheweth to have been done;</hi> Peter <hi>ſaying,</hi> Unto us who eat and drank with him after he was riſen from the dead. He will have it, that this fruit of the Vine which our Saviour drank when he ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated his Sacrament, was of the ſame nature with that which he drank with his Apoſtles after his Reſurrection. But beſides all theſe Teſtimonies which are commonly alledged out of the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of <hi>Amalarius,</hi> we have others, for which we are beholden unto <hi>Dom Luke d'Achery,</hi> a Benedictine Friar. <hi>Rantgarius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Noyon</hi> demanded of him, how he underſtood theſe words of the Inſtitution of the Sacrament; <hi>This is the Cup of my Blood of the New and Eternal Teſtament,</hi> with this Addition which is in the Canon of the Maſs, <hi>The Myſtery of Faith. Amalarius</hi> anſwers him by Letter; wherein, after having ſpoken unto him of the Paſchal Cup, he paſſeth unto the Sacramental; and having alledged what St. <hi>Luke</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Amalar. ad Rantgar. t. 7.

                     <hi>The ſame Cup</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is called the Myſtery of Faith,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> becauſe he that believes that he was redeemed by this blood, and that doth imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate his paſſion, is profited thereby unto Salvation and Eternal Life; which made our Saviour himſelf to ſay,</hi> If you eat not the Fleſh of the Son of Man, nor drink his Blood, you have no life in you; <hi>that is to ſay, if you participate not of my paſſion, and if you believe not that I dyed for your ſalvation, you have no life in you.</hi> This is the conſtant Doctrine of St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> He alſo teſtifies in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words, that he gloried in being one of his followers: <hi>The Myſtery is the Faith,</hi>

<note place="margin">Id. ad Guntard.

<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 171.</note> That it is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt which may be caſt out in ſpitting after having received it, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſome part may be caſt out of the mouth.</hi> Unto all which he adds, <hi>Having ſo received the Body of Chriſt with a good intention, I don't in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to argue whether it be inviſibly lifted up unto Heaven, or whether it remains in our bodies until the day of our Death; or whether it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haled into the Air, or whether it departs out of the body with the blood, or whether it goes out at the pores; our Saviour ſaying,</hi>

<note place="margin">Ibid. l. 1. c. 12.</note> 
                     <hi>That by benediction, it is converted into a Sacrament:</hi> Therefore he gives us to underſtand, that this Sacrament which we receive, and that he calls the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe of ſome likeneſs, as he explained himſelf by the words of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> is ſubject unto divers accidents, whereto the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt cannot be expos'd, particularly of going into the place of Excrements like other Meats.

                  <p>Unto <hi>Rabanus</hi> and <hi>Amalarius,</hi> I will joyn <hi>Wallafridus Strabo,</hi> who in all probability wrote his Book of Eccleſiaſtical matters betwixt the years 840. and 849.
<note place="margin">In Poemate.</note> which was the time of his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe. In that he calls <hi>Rabanus</hi> his Father and Maſter, it may give cauſe to conceive that he was of one Judgment with him; but becauſe meer ſurmiſes are not ſufficient proof nor convincing Arguments;
<note place="margin">Walafri. Stra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bo lib. de Reb. Eccleſ. c. 16. Bibl. p. 7. t. 10.</note> let us learn from his own mouth what he believed of the Myſtery which we examine. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>gave to his Diſciples the Sacraments of his body and blood in the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine, teaching them to celebrate it in Commemoration of his moſt holy paſſion, becauſe there could nothing be found more fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting then theſe ſpecies, to ſignifie the Unity of the head and his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers; for as the Bread is made of ſeveral Grains, and is reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to one body by means of Water; and as the Wine is preſſed from ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Grapes, ſo alſo the body of Jeſus Chriſt is made of the Union of a multitude of believers.</hi> And a little after he declares, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt hath choſen for us a reaſonable Sacrifice for the Myſtery of his body and of his blood; in that</hi> Melchiſedek <hi>having offered Bread and Wine, he gave unto believers the ſame kind of ſacrifice.</hi>
                     <pb n="401" facs="tcp:47504:203"/>And again, <hi>That as for that great number of legal ſacrifices,
<note place="margin">Id. cap. 18.</note> Jeſus Chriſt gave us the Word of his Goſpel; ſo alſo for that great diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of ſacrifices, believers ſhould reſt ſatisfied with the Oblation of Bread and Wine.</hi> As all theſe paſſages are exceeding clear, ſo it is very juſt and reaſonable they ſhould ſerve for a Commentary unto others, if it had hapned that <hi>Wallafridus</hi> had ſpoken leſs clear any where elſe; for then ſhould that judicious rule of <hi>Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tullians</hi> be practiſed, <hi>That the plaineſt things ſhould prevail,
<note place="margin">Tertull. de Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrect. carn. c. 19. &amp; 21.</note> and that the moſt certaine ſhould preſcribe againſt the uncertain; things which are doubtful ſhould be judged by thoſe things which are certain, and thoſe which are obſcure, by thoſe which are clear and manifeſt.</hi> Let us apply this unto what <hi>Wallafridus</hi> ſaith in another place, which the Latins forget not, that is to ſay,
<note place="margin">Id. cap. 17.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Myſteries of our Redemption are truly the body and blood of our Saviour.</hi> And we ſhall find, ſay the Proteſtants, that he ſo explained himſelf, in regard to their Efficacy and their Vertue, and of the real and effectual communication of this Body and Blood in the lawful uſe of this Sacrament; and not to ſay that they are ſubſtantially this Body and Blood; becauſe that is inconſiſtent with the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he made juſt before, <hi>That the Sacraments of the body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt is the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine;</hi> whereas theſe things accord very well with ſaying, that although the Sacraments are Bread and Wine in ſubſtance, yet they are for all that, truly the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt in Efficacy and in Vertue; becauſe they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed accompanied with the Vertue and Efficacy of his Divine Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and of his precious Blood; the term of <hi>truly,</hi> being oppoſed not unto <hi>figuratively</hi> or <hi>ſacramentally;</hi> (for that would be a contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſeeing he ſpeaks of <hi>Myſteries</hi>) but it is oppoſed unto <hi>untruth,</hi> as if the Sacrament were not at all the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; unto <hi>vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> as if it had only the bare name; and <hi>nefficaciouſly,</hi> as if it had not the virtue. And that this is the true ſenſe of the words of <hi>Wallafri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus,</hi> it appears by the title of the Chapter, entituled, <hi>Of the vertue of the Sacraments:</hi> in which Chapter, the more to advance the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy, he, with many of the Ancients, particularly with <hi>Rabanus</hi> his Maſter, and with <hi>Ratramn</hi> his Contemporary, interprets the 6th of St. <hi>John,</hi> not of the Fleſh and Blood it ſelf of Jeſus Chriſt, but of the Sacraments of his Body and Blood; or, to ſpeak with St. <hi>Fulgentius, Of the Myſteries of the Truth,
<note place="margin">Fulgent. de Bapt. Aethiop.</note> and not of the Truth of the Myſteries.</hi> This is the Reaſoning of Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>At the ſame time time that <hi>Wallafridus</hi> wrote his Book, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribald,</hi> or <hi>Heribold,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auxerr,</hi> was in great Reputation; but becauſe we have that to ſay of this Prelate as will give a very great weight unto his Teſtimony, we will reſerve him for a Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto himſelf; and in the mean while we will ſay ſomething

But theſe ſorts of Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences are too weak to be inſiſted upon; therefore I will ſeek for ſomething in his Writings that is more material: as in one of his Letters unto <hi>Amulus</hi> or <hi>Amulo</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Lyons,</hi> in behalf of <hi>Guenilo</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Sans,</hi> and of Count <hi>Gerrard</hi> in ſpeaking of Jeſus Chriſt,

Unto which may be added what he ſaith in the Book of three Queſtions,
<note place="margin">Id. de tribus quaeſt. p. 208, 209. ult. edit.</note> which Monſieur <hi>Baluze</hi> proves to be his; to wit, <hi>That God hath ſubjected ſpiritual Creatures unto time only; but as for bodily things, he hath ſubjected them unto time, and unto place: and that it cannot be queſtioned, if it be conſidered, that all bodies that have length, breadth and depth, and which are called ſolid are never contained but in one place.</hi> It is evident that he means of being contained circumſcriptively, otherwiſe his Oppoſition would be inſignificant; being certain that Spirits, for inſtance, Angels alſo fill a place; ſo that whilſt they are here, they are not there: and this is termed to be in a place definitively. But to be there cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſcriptively, appertains only unto Bodies; which being made up of ſeveral parts, are in ſuch manner ſcituated in the place which they fill, that each part of the Body anſwers unto each part of the place;
<note place="margin">St. Fulgent. ad Pet. Diac. c. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>It not being given unto Bodies to exiſt after the manner of Spirits,</hi> to uſe the terms of St. <hi>Fulgentius.</hi> Seeing then that the Abbot <hi>de Ferriers</hi> ſpeaks after this manner of the exiſting of Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and that he believes it inſeparable from every Corporal Creature, without excepting the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, it follows, that he believed not this Exiſtence after the manner of a Spirit, which is attributed unto him in the Latin Church; nor by conſequence, the real Preſence, whereupon it depends, as one of its neceſſary Conſequences. This is what ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral do infer from this paſſage.</p>
                  <p>The Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald, being informed that his Subjects were not all of one Opinion touching the Doctrine of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, thought it neceſſary to conſult ſome of the moſt Learned of his Kingdom, and ſuch as were of greateſt Credit and Eſteem. Amongſt others which he made choice of to write on this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,
<pb n="403" facs="tcp:47504:204"/>he choſe two perſons whom he eſteemed very much; the one was <hi>Bertram,</hi> or as he is called by the Writers of that Age, <hi>Ratramn;</hi> which is his true name: and the other was <hi>John,</hi> Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named <hi>Erigenius,</hi> of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that is to ſay, of <hi>Ireland,</hi> according to the Language of our times. Their Writings have not had the ſame fate; for thoſe of <hi>Ratramn</hi> have been preſerved unto us, but as for thoſe of <hi>John,</hi> they were condemned and burnt two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years after, at the Council of <hi>Verceill.</hi> And as they were two ſeveral Writers, ſo we muſt alſo diſtinguiſh them in this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, and that we ſpeak of each of them ſeverally. To begin with <hi>Ratramn,</hi> Prieſt of the Monaſtery of <hi>Corby,</hi> and afterwards Abbot of <hi>Orbais;</hi> I ſay, he was a Man ſo eſteemed in his time, that all the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> made choice of him to defend the Latin Church againſt the Greeks; and by the induſtry of <hi>Dom Luke d'Achery,</hi> a Benedictine Friar, we have in our hands the four Books which he compoſed; and are ſuch, that when I compare them with that written by <hi>Eneas,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> in the ſame Century, and in defence of the ſame Cauſe; I find as great dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betwixt them, as betwixt Light and Darkneſs; or, at leaſt, betwixt the weak Eſſay of ſome illiterate perſon, and the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed Work of an exquiſite Artiſt; becauſe in truth, the Work of <hi>Eneas</hi> is extreamly weak, in compariſon of that of <hi>Ratramn:</hi> I ſay, of that <hi>Ratramn,</hi> unto whom the Abbot <hi>Trithemius</hi> aſcribes ſuch great Commendations in the XV Century; and whom the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Defenders of the free Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo much admired, when they made uſe of what he wrote touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Doctrine of Predeſtination. Therefore the Preſident <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin,</hi> ſpeaking of him, ſaid,
<note place="margin">Mauguin. diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertat. Hiſt. &amp; Chron. c. 17. t. 2. p. 133. 135.</note> that he was a learned Doctor of the Church, <hi>Non levis Armaturae in Eccleſia Chriſti Militem: Emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in Probity, and in Doctrine; an undaunted and powerful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender and Protector of the Catholick Verity, againſt Innovators.</hi> It was this <hi>Ratramn,</hi> whom <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald conſulted upon the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Sacrament, to be informed by him what was the true Opinion of the Church; and who by his Order, wrote the little Treatiſe, <hi>Of the Body and Blood of our Saviour:</hi> The Deſtiny where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of was more favourable than that of <hi>John Erigenius</hi>'s Book, which is deſtroyed, whereas the other is ſtill in Being.
<note place="margin">Ep. ad Dom. Luc. d'Achery t. 2. Spicileg. praeſ.</note> I know the late Monſieur <hi>de Marca</hi> ſaid, that the Book of <hi>John Erigenius,</hi> and that of <hi>Bertram,</hi> or <hi>Ratramn,</hi> was but one and the ſame thing; and that the true Author of it was <hi>John Erigenius,</hi> who having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed his Name, cloaked it under that of <hi>Bertram;</hi> but in truth, nothing can be ſeen weaker than the Conjecture of this illuſtrious Prelate. I have often admired that ſo learned and underſtanding a perſon as Monſieur <hi>de Marca</hi> ſhould have ſuch a thought: for
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:47504:205"/>if he had taken the pains to have compared this little Treatiſe whereof we ſpeak, with the other Works of <hi>Ratramn,</hi> and with what remains unto us of <hi>John Erigenius</hi>'s, he would never have gone about to have taken it from the one, to have given it unto the other; becauſe the Style is wholly <hi>Ratramn</hi>'s, and is nothing like unto that of <hi>Joh. Scot:</hi> for the ſaying that <hi>Berengarius</hi> frequently made mention of <hi>John Scot,</hi> and that he made no mention of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramn,</hi> is to ſay nothing to the purpoſe; for it may be, that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius</hi> might ſpeak of him, and that it might not come unto our knowledge; or if he did not ſpeak of him, it might be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Bertram</hi>'s Book was not come to his hands, as that of <hi>John Erigenius</hi>'s was. Doth it not very often come to paſs that ſmall Treatiſes, as that of <hi>Ratramn</hi>'s was, do at firſt make a great noiſe, but a hundred or two hundred years after, they are, as it were, buried in Oblivion, that ſcarce any hath knowledge of them. And who knows but the ſame fate may one day befall the great and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Works of this illuſtrious Archbiſhop; I mean, his eight Books of the Privileges of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church. This great Man adds the Teſtimony of <hi>Aſcelin;</hi> who making Anſwer unto a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> doth make mention of an Interpretation given by <hi>John Erigenius</hi> unto ſome paſſages of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt, very agreeable unto that which <hi>Ratramn</hi> alſo gives them; and from thence infers, to confirm his Hypotheſis, that the Book of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramn</hi> and of <hi>John Erigenius</hi> was but one and the ſame Book, and compoſed by this latter. But let me again take the liberty to ſay, that this is no ſolid Reaſon. <hi>John Erigenius</hi> and <hi>Ratramn</hi> diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt one and the ſame Adverſary, they both pleaded the ſame Cauſe; wherefore then might they not employ the like Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and explain after the ſame manner the words of <hi>Gregory,</hi> now ſpoken of. And to ſay the truth, if the reaſoning of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur <hi>de Marca</hi> ſhould be admitted, it would follow, that <hi>Tertul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſhould be but one and the ſame Author, ſeeing they both write, and almoſt in the ſame Terms, that Jeſus Chriſt gave unto his Diſciples the Figure of his Body. And that more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it doth not appear that the Explication of <hi>John Erigenius</hi> is whole and entire word for word in <hi>Ratramn:</hi> It is concerning theſe words of the ancient Latin Liturgy; <hi>We beſeech thee, O Lord, that thy Sacraments may accompliſh in us what they contain; to the end we may receive in ſubſtance what we now perform in appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. Aſcelin,</hi> upon whoſe Teſtimony this learned Prelate doth relie, makes <hi>John Erigenius</hi> ſay, <hi>Specie, inquit, geruntur iſta, non veritate:</hi> But the words found in <hi>Ratramn</hi> are; <hi>Dicit quod in ſpecie, gerantur iſta, non in veritate.</hi> See here already ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in the Conſtruction, and in the Terms. Beſides, we know
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:47504:205"/>not if <hi>John Erigenius</hi> joyned unto his words this Paraphraſe, which <hi>Ratramn</hi> joyned unto his; <hi>Id eſt per ſimilitudinem, non per ipſius rei manifeſtationem;</hi> that is to ſay, by reſemblance, and not by manifeſtation of the thing it ſelf. It cannot then be ſaid for certain, that the Explication of <hi>John Erigenius</hi> is to be found <hi>verbatim</hi> in <hi>Bertram:</hi> for although they agree both as to the Ground of the Explication, and that in ſubſtance they expreſſed themſelves alike; nevertheleſs, it cannot be denied but that there was ſome diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence in their Expreſſions. I am very ſorry that this illuſtrious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late had not always followed the truth, and that it was his fortune ſometimes to run againſt the conſtant Current and Truth of Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory; as when he pretends to vindicate Pope <hi>honorius</hi> from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tainted with the Hereſie of the <hi>Monothelites,</hi> when he would make the Foundation of Churches in <hi>France</hi> to be ancienter than indeed it is, when he undertook to derive the Inſtitution of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chipresbyters</hi> from the Will and good Liking of Biſhops of Cities, and other things, which it may be, may ſome time or other be enquired into. And to conclude, that the Books of <hi>Ratramn,</hi> and of <hi>John Erigenius</hi> ſhould be but one and the ſame Book, againſt the truth of Hiſtory.</p>

                     <hi>That one ought to make light of what a new Writer doth relate of ancient Tranſactions, if he be not countenanced by the Authority of ſome elder than himſelf.</hi> Of much greater reaſon then ſhould he be rejected, when he directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the Teſtimony of the Ancients.

And after all this, conclude that the Treatiſe of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood of Chriſt, which we have under the name of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramn,</hi> is truly his; and that it was publiſhed in the time of <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald, by whoſe Command he wrote it. Father <hi>Cellot</hi> the Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:47504:206"/>never made any difficulty of this matter, freely attributing unto <hi>Ratramn</hi> the little Treatiſe whereof we ſpeak; and proving by a long Diſpute, that he was the Fore-runner of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> and of <hi>Calvin:</hi> and that he openly taught, that the Euchariſt is not the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt; which he confirms by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of perſons moſt learned in the Communion of the Latins; <hi>Allain, Deſpans, de Saints, du Perron, Clement</hi> the Eighth; which all have had this ſame Opinion of <hi>Bertram,</hi> and of his Book. He obſerves that Cardinal <hi>Bellarmin</hi> doth rank him amongſt thoſe which have diſputed whether the Euchariſt is the real Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and that it was juſtly put in the Index of prohibited Books, according to the intention of the Council of <hi>Trent.</hi> As for <hi>Sixtus de Sienna,</hi> he found it ſo contrary unto the Belief of the Latin Church, that he took it to be ſome of the Works of <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lompadius,</hi> which the Proteſtants publiſhed in the name of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramn.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is commonly ſaid, that ſecond thoughts are better than the firſt; but Monſieur <hi>de Marca</hi> ſeems to go about to give the Lie unto this Maxim by his Conduct: for in this French Treatiſe of the Euchariſt, a little before mentioned, and which he had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed before what we but now examined of his, he very judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly attributes unto <hi>Bertram</hi> this little Treatiſe of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; and ſaith, <hi>That he was conſulted on this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by</hi> Charles <hi>the Bald:</hi> This is that whereto he ſhould have held, and not to change his Opinion without any ſolid Ground. And it ought not to be ſaid with ſome, that <hi>Bertram,</hi> who was a Friar in an Abby whereof <hi>Paſchas</hi> was Abbot, durſt not therefore write againſt him: for in the firſt place, who told thoſe perſons that <hi>Bertram</hi> was yet a Friar in the Monaſtery of <hi>Gorby</hi> when he wrote againſt <hi>Paſchas,</hi> when probably he was Abbot of <hi>Orbais,</hi> and no way depending upon <hi>Paſchas.</hi> And for my part, I find much more likelihood of the laſt, than of the former. In the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond place, Wherefore is it that <hi>Ratramn</hi> ſhould not dare to write againſt what <hi>Paſchas</hi> writ touching the Sacrament of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, ſeeing he feared not in other things directly to oppoſe one of the neceſſary Conſequences of <hi>Paſchas</hi> his Opinion, and plainly to call it Hereſie; as we have fully made it appear in the 13th Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pter of the ſecond Part of this Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>It may then boldly and without danger be affirmed, after the teſtimony of ſo many Learned Men of the Communion of <hi>Rome,</hi> that <hi>Ratramn</hi> was an Adverſary unto <hi>Paſchas:</hi> But to make this truth appear in its full luſtre, it is requiſite to alledge ſome paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of this ſmall Treatiſe, after having ſhewed, that all there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in amounted to prove two things; one is, That the Myſtery of
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:47504:206"/>the Euchariſt is a Figure, and not the thing it ſelf; and the other, That 'tis not the ſame Body which is born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> as <hi>Paſchas</hi> did teach it was: In fine, having firſt of all ſaid unto <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald,
<note place="margin">Bertram de corp. &amp; ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin Dom.</note> 
                     <hi>That there being nothing better becoming his Royal Wiſdom, then to have a Catholick Opinion of the ſacred Myſteries, and not to ſuffer that his Subjects ſhould be of different Judgments touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, wherein we know is the Abridgment of Chriſtian Religion, he propoſed two queſtions wherein the King de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to be reſolved:</hi> 1. <hi>Whether the body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt which Chriſtians do receive with the mouth, be made in myſtery or in reality?</hi> And 2. <hi>Whether it be the ſame Body which was born of the Virgin, that ſuffered, dyed, roſe again, aſcended into Heaven, and is ſet down at the right hand of God the Father? Paſchas</hi> taught, That it was the ſame Fleſh as was born of the holy Virgin; and his Adverſaries on the contrary, That it was the Figure, and the Sacrament, and not the real Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>If then <hi>Ratramn</hi> taught, That the Euchariſt is the Figure, and the Sacrament of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and not the very Fleſh it ſelf, of neceſſity it muſt be concluded, that he directly oppoſed the Opinion of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> according to the Declaration made us by the Anonymous Author.

Ibid.</note> As to what regards the firſt queſtion, ſee here how it is reſolved: <q>I demand <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> of thoſe that will not here admit of a Figure, and that will have all to be taken ſimply, and in reality; I ſay, I would ask of them to what purpoſe was the change made, that it ſhould no longer be Bread and Wine, as it was before, but the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; for according to the bodily appearance, and the viſible form of things, the Bread and Wine have no change in them; and if they have ſuffered no change, then they be nothing elſe but what they were before. And a little after,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> there offers here a queſtion, which is made by ſeveral, ſaying, That theſe things are made in Figure, and not in reality; and ſo ſaying, they ſhew themſelves contrary to the Writings of the Holy Fathers.</q> And after having alledged two paſſages of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> one of the third Book of Chriſtian Doctrine, and the other of the Epiſtle unto <hi>Boniface,</hi> he concludes, <q>We find that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> That the Sacraments are other things than that whereof they be Sacraments; the Body wherein Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered, and the Blood which flowed out of his Side, are the things; but the Myſteries of theſe things are the Sacraments of this Body and of this Blood, which are celebrated in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the Death of our Saviour, not only once a year at the Solemnity of Eaſter, but alſo every day. And although there is but one Body wherein our Saviour ſuffered, and one
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:47504:207"/>Blood which he ſhed for the ſins of the World; nevertheleſs, the Sacraments take the name of the things whereof they be Sacraments, and are called the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, by reaſon of the reſemblance they have with the things which they repreſent; as the Death and Reſurrection of our Lord, which are celebrated yearly on certain days, although he ſuffered and roſe but once in himſelf. Thoſe days cannot be brought back again, ſeeing they are paſt; but the days whereon the Commemoration of the Paſſion and Reſurrection of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is made, are called by their names, becauſe of the reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance they have with thoſe whereon our Saviour ſuffered and roſe again, In like manner, we ſay our Saviour is ſacrificed, when the Sacraments of his Paſſion is celebrated, although he ſuffered but once in himſelf for the Salvation of the World. He ſaith moreover,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that thoſe which believe the reality, make a true confeſſion, when they ſay, That it is the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, but that they deny what they ſeem to affirm, and that they themſelves deſtroy what they believe; for when they ſay ſo (ſaith he) they acknowledge that it is not what it was before;
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and that the Bread and the Wine have been changed: Now we ſee there is no corporal change paſſed; they muſt then of neceſſity confeſs the change is paſſed in ſome other regard, than in reſpect of the Bodies; from whence he concludes, That they muſt be conſtrained to deny,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> either that it is the Body or Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which is not to be permitted to ſay, nor even to think; or, if they confeſs that it is the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, ſeeing that cannot be, without there was a change for the better, that this change is paſſed Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally. Then it follows, that it is paſſed Spiritually, that is to ſay,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> Figuratively; inaſmuch as the Spiritual body, and the Spiritual blood of Jeſus Chriſt, is under the Vail of bodily Bread and corporal Wine.</q> And to inform us clearly of his intention, he adds, <q>It is not that two ſeveral things exiſt in the Sacrament, one whereof is Corporal, and the other Spiritual, no, but it is one and the ſame thing, that in one regard, is the Element of Bread and Wine; and in another regard is the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt;
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> for in regard of what we touch Corporally, they be the Elements, or bodily Creatures; but in regard of what they were made Spiritually, they be the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. He alſo affirms, That what we receive outwardly in the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, is proper to nouriſh the Body.</q>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="409" facs="tcp:47504:207"/>
                  <p>And from thence, paſſing to the Examination of the ſecond Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, to wit,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>whether that which Believers do receive with the mouth daily in the Church by the Myſtery of the Sacraments, be the ſame Body that was born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>that ſuffered, and was buried, and which ſitteth on the Right Hand of God:</hi> He thus explains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <q>Theſe Creatures, in regard of their ſubſtance,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> are after Conſecration, the ſame they were before; they were Bread and Wine, and it is viſible that they remain in the ſame kind, although they be conſecrated. The Change then which paſſes here by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, is internal; what Faith beholds, doth nouriſh the Soul, and communicates unto it the ſubſtance of Life eternal. <hi>And again,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> The Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt which was crucified, was made of the Fleſh of the Virgin <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> compoſed of Bones and Sinews, divided by the Lineaments of Members, furniſhed with a reaſonable Soul, from which it received life and motion: But as for the ſpiritual Fleſh, which ſpiritually feedeth the faithful people; it is made according to what it is outwardly, of Grains of Wheat, by the hands of the Baker; without Bones and Nerves, without diverſity of Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, without a reaſonable Soul, or exerciſing any Life or Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for all that is in it which communicates Life unto us, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a ſpiritual Vertue, from an inviſible Efficacy, and from a divine Benediction. Therefore it is quite another thing in regard of what appears outwardly, from what is believed of the Myſtery; whereas the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt which was crucified, is not inwardly what it appears to be outwardly, becauſe it is the Fleſh of a real Man, and by conſequence a true Body, exiſting in the form of a true Body. It muſt alſo be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is not alone repreſented in this Bread, but that the Body of the faithful people is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in figured alſo. Therefore it is that the Bread is made of divers Grains, becauſe the Body of the people is compoſed of many Believers; and as the Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally, the numbers of the people which believe in Jeſus Chriſt are therein alſo repreſented myſtically: and as this Bread is the Body of Believers, not corporally, but ſpiritually; it is alſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to underſtand the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, not corporally, but ſpiritually. So alſo it is commanded to mingle Water with the Wine, which is called the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; and it is not permitted to offer the one without the other, becauſe the People cannot be without Jeſus Chriſt, nor Jeſus Chriſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the People; as the Head cannot ſubſiſt without the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, nor the Members without the Head: and the Water in this Sacrament bears the Image of the People. If this Wine,
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:47504:208"/>ſanctified by the Miniſtry of Prieſts, were corporally changed into the Blood of Chriſt, it would be neceſſary that the Water, which is therein alſo mingled, ſhould be corporally changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Blood of faithful Believers; for where there is one and the ſame Sanctification, there muſt be alſo of neceſſity, one Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration; and where this is one and the ſame reaſon, there will alſo be one and the ſame Myſtery. Now we ſee there is no Change made in the Water according to the Body; therefore by conſequence it muſt follow, that there is no bodily Change made in the Wine. All that is ſignified by the Water, in regard of the Body of the People, is taken ſpiritually; all then that is ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Wine, in reference to the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, ought neceſſarily to be underſtood ſpiritually. Beſides, the things which do differ in themſelves are not one and the ſame things: The Body of Jeſus Chriſt which ſuffered, and is riſen again, was made immortal, and dieth no more; Death hath no more Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over him; he is eternal, and cannot die: Now this Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which is celebrated in the Church is temporal, and not eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal; corruptible, and not incorruptible; it is in the way, and not in the Country: they do then differ, therefore they be not the ſame; then if they be not the ſame, how is it that they call them the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and his real Blood? For if it be the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and that one may truly ſay ſo, the Body of Jeſus Chriſt being incorruptible, impaſſible, and by conſequence eternal. It muſt neceſſarily follow, that this Body of Jeſus Chriſt which is made in the Church ſhould be incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible and eternal: but it cannot be denied but that it is cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, becauſe being broken in pieces, it is divided unto Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, which receive it; and being eaten with the Teeth, it is ſwallowed down, and goeth into the Belly. What we do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriorly is then another thing from what we believe by Faith; what regards the ſenſe of the Body is corruptible, but what is believed by Faith is incorruptible. What appears outwardly is not the thing it ſelf, but the Image of the thing; and what the heart feeleth and underſtandeth, is the reality of the thing.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine; for the whole Book muſt be tranſcribed, if all ſhould be alledged that makes directly contrary unto the Doctrine of <hi>Paſchas;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> he thus concludes the whole Treatiſe; <q>Let your Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom conſider, illuſtrious Prince, that we have very clearly proved by the Teſtimony of the holy Scripture, and by Paſſages of the holy Fathers, that the Bread which is called the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Cup which is called his Blood, are Figures, becauſe a Sacrament; and that there is a great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Body which is by Myſtery, and the Body which ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered,
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:47504:208"/>which was buried, and roſe again: This here is the real Body of our Saviour, where there is neither Figure nor Signifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; but the evidence of the thing it ſelf is preſent. The Faithful deſire to behold him becauſe he is our Head, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that in his ſight conſiſts the joy of our Souls; for the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and him are but one: which is to be underſtood, not in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Body which our Lord hath aſſumed, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the fulneſs of the Divinity which inhabits in Jeſus Chriſt God-man; but the myſtical Body is a Figure, not only of the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt, but alſo of the believing People; for it bears the Figure both of the one and the other Body of Jeſus Chriſt; that is to ſay, of Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, which was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, and is riſen again; and of the People which are born again in Jeſus Chriſt by Baptiſm, and was raiſed from the Dead. Unto which may be added, that this Bread and this Cup, which are called the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, are a Memorial of the Death and Sufferings of our Saviour, as himſelf hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in the Goſpel, ſaying, <hi>Do this in remembrance of me:</hi> which St. <hi>Paul</hi> expounds after this manner; <hi>As often as ye ſhall eat this bread, and drink of this cup, you ſhew forth the death of the Lord until he come.</hi> It is then our Saviour, and St. <hi>Paul</hi> which teach us, that this Bread and Cup that are ſet upon the Altar, are there laid as a Figure, or Memorial of the death of our Saviour.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as <hi>Ratramn</hi> oppoſed himſelf directly againſt the Opinion of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> ſo he alſo refuted the Conſequence of this Belief, by oppoſing in his Book of the Birth of Jeſus Chriſt, what <hi>Paſchas</hi> had written of the Delivery of the bleſſed Virgin. For in this little Treatiſe he poſitively affirms the Locality, or the Incluſion of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt within the bounds of the place which it occupieth; whereas the Hypotheſis of his Adverſary impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that it could be in ſeveral places at the ſame time.
<note place="margin">In Spicil. d'A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. t. 1. p. 333</note> 
                     <hi>In hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>you wickedly utter a kind of Novelty, to cry, that there was nothing could hinder our Saviour that he ſhould not be born, becauſe no Creature could reſiſt the Creator; but that all things that do ſubſiſt, are open and penetrable unto him. Whilſt you judge ſo, you judge very prudently; but when by this rule you go about to ſubject the beginnings of the Birth of Jeſus Chriſt, you plainly dog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matize, as to what regards his Power: but as to what regards the property of the Body which he hath taken, and his Humane Birth, you ſtray very far from the way of Truth; for there is nothing firm, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is not penetrable unto the Power of the Will of Jeſus Chriſt. But as for the Humanity which he hath taken, it was incloſed and ſhut up in the Virgins Womb; that during the time it remained there, it was not elſewhere: but in a ſhort time it left the Abode of the Virgins
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:47504:209"/>Womb, and went forth, and returned no more thither. What is it that he hath ſhewed by this change of place, if it be not, that though he be omnipreſent by the propriety of his Divinity, he was but in one place according to the circumſcription of his Body? That that which is local, as it is not always every where, but it goes unto one place when it leaves the other: ſo alſo alſo when he goeth from one place to another, he at the ſame time is not at the right hand and at the left; neither walketh he before and behind, nor above and below. So alſo the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, as he was at one time in the Womb of the Virgin, according to the Fleſh, and at another time he was out of it; ſo in going out, though nothing could ſtop him when he would come out, nevertheleſs he made uſe only of one way for his coming forth; and he iſſued not out by all the parts of the body wherein he had been formed.</hi> I will not here ſay any thing of certain <hi>Sterconariſtes,</hi> which ſome pretend to have been oppoſed by <hi>Ratramn,</hi> and not by <hi>Paſchas:</hi> Others ſay, he was one of this Sect himſelf; and others, in fine, That in diſputing againſt it, he varied from the true Sentiments of the Church; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we will treat of it in examining the Teſtimony of <hi>Heribold.</hi>

                  <p>To continue the Courſe of my Hiſtory, I come to <hi>John Erige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> the other Doctor which the Emperor <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, and whom he commanded to write upon the ſame Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.

<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> when he adds, <hi>This Body and this Blood is not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther'd in the Ears of Corn, and in the Grapes: Nature gives it not unto us, but it is Conſecration that maketh it unto us myſtically. Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt is eaten when the Creature of Bread and Wine paſs into the the Sacrament of his Fleſh and Blood by the ineffable Sanctification of the Holy Ghoſt: he is eaten by parcels in the Sacrament, and he remains entire in Heaven, and entire in your heart.</hi> He would ſay that the Euchariſt is naturally Bread and Wine; that Conſecration makes it the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, which is eaten in Morſels under the Sign, which repreſents him: but as to himſelf, he is whole and entire in Heaven, as he is whole and entire in the heart of every Believer, in quality of a quickning and ſaving Object, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced by Faith, ſo to find Life and Salvation in partaking of him, becauſe it is he that hath merited Salvation for us by his Death, and purchaſed Life for us by his Sufferings. And as the Euchariſt is the Memorial of this Death and theſe Sufferings, <hi>Florus</hi> makes no difficulty to ſay, that it is made unto Believers the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe in participating of this Divine Myſtery, Faith looks unto him as the only Object of its Contemplation, Manducation, and Participation. Thus much theſe other words of the ſame Author import;
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 171.</note> 
                     <hi>All that is done in the Oblation of the Body and Blood of our Lord is myſtical: we ſee one thing, and
<pb n="417" facs="tcp:47504:211"/>we underſtand another; what is ſeen is corporal, what is underſtood hath a ſpiritual Fruit.</hi> Moreover, he ſaith plainly, that what our Saviour commanded his Diſciples to take and eat, was Bread, <hi>He ſaid unto them of the Bread,</hi> Take, and eat ye all of this.
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> And ſpeaking of the Cup; <hi>The Wine</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>was the Myſtery of our Redemption.</hi> And he proves it by theſe words, <hi>I will no more drink of this Fruit of the Vine.</hi> In fine, expounding theſe laſt words of the Maſs, <hi>Whereby, O Lord,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> thou always createſt for us all theſe good things,</hi> &amp;c. which is a kind of Thankſgiving, which in the Latin Liturgy doth follow the Conſecration, he ſufficiently gives to underſtand, that he believed not that the Bread and Wine were changed into the ſubſtance of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; ſeeing he ſpeaks of them as of things which God had created from the beginning of the World, which he maketh ſtill every year, by Propagation, and by Reparation; which he ſanctifieth and fills with his Grace and Heavenly Bleſſing; which himſelf interprets to be of Corn, and of Wine. Thus it is that many do explain the meaning of this Author.</p>
                  <p>About the ſame time that the Deacon <hi>Florus</hi> wrote at <hi>Lyons, Chriſtian Druthmar</hi> Prieſt and Friar of <hi>Corby,</hi> and Companion or <hi>Ratramn</hi> in the ſame Monaſtery, compoſed his Commentary up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on St. <hi>Matthew</hi>'s Goſpel; and we ſhould forthwith ſee what he wrote of the Euchariſt, if <hi>Sixtus Senenſis</hi> did not ſtop us a little moment. This famous Library-keeper doth accuſe Proteſtants of having corrupted the Text of <hi>Druthmar,</hi> in Reading, <hi>in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;</hi> whereas he pretends, upon the Credit of the Copy of a Manuſcript to be ſeen in the Library of the <hi>Franciſcans</hi> at <hi>Lyons,</hi> that it ſhould be read, <hi>Subſiſting really in the Sacrament.</hi> The firſt thing we ſhould do then, is to conſider the nature of this Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for the faith of <hi>Sixtus</hi> is look'd upon by many, as the faith of a Man that approves very well of Expurgatory Indexes, and one that hath laid two other Accuſations unto the ſame Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants Charge, which are believed to be falſe.

In fine, ſay they, <q>It on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly is requiſite to read over the whole paſſage with ſome caution, to know that the Correction of <hi>Sixtus</hi> cannot ſubfiſt; and that by conſequence, his Accuſation is groundleſs.</q> And to the end the Reader might do it conveniently, I will relate it at large, as he hath tranſmitted it unto us:

<pb n="419" facs="tcp:47504:212"/>up again. [And he gave it unto his Diſciples, ſaying unto them, Take, and eat; this is my Body.] <hi>He gave to his Diſciples the Sacrament of his Body for remiſſion of ſins, and preſervation of chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; to the end that being mindful of this action, they ſhould always do this in Figure, and that they ſhould not forget what he was going to do for them.</hi> [This is my Body.] <hi>That is to ſay, in Sacrament.</hi> [And having taken the Cup, he gave Thanks, and gave it unto his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples.] <hi>As amongſt all things which are uſeful to preſerve life, Bread and Wine are thoſe which do moſt ſtrengthen and repair the weakneſs of our Nature, it is with great reaſon that our Saviour would in theſe two things eſtabliſh the Myſtery of his Sacrament; for Wine rejoyceth the heart, and increaſeth blood; therefore it is very fit to repreſent the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe all that cometh from him rejoyceth with perfect joy, and increaſeth all that is good in us. In fine, like a perſon undertaking a great Voyage, he leaves unto them he loves, a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar mark of his Love, upon condition that they ſhall take care to keep it always, thereby to remember him: ſo alſo God, ſpiritually changing the Bread into his Body, and the Wine into his Blood, hath comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us to celebrate this myſtery, to the end theſe two things may eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally make us remember what he hath done for us with his Body and Blood; and that it might hinder us from being ungrateful, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mindful of ſo great and tender Love. Now becauſe we are wont to mix Water with the Wine in the Sacrament of his Blood, this Water repreſents the faithful People for whom Jeſus Chriſt would lay down his Life; and the Water is not without the Wine, neither is the Wine without the Water; becauſe that as he died for us, ſo alſo we ſhould be ready to die for him, and for our brethren; that is to ſay, for the Church; therefore there came out of his ſide Water and Blood.</hi> This paſſage is taken out of a Commentary, where the Author explains theſe words of the Inſtitution, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> by theſe others, <hi>That is to ſay, in the Sacrament;</hi> to ſignifie that the Bread of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt is not really the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, but only the Sacrament of it. Therefore he ſheweth that our Saviour gave unto his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples the Sacrament of his Body; that he commanded them to celebrate the Euchariſt in Figure of what he was going to do for them; that his Blood is figured by the Wine; and that in going up to Heaven, he left them this Pledge of his Love, to the end, that during his abſence, they ſhould always make Commemora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Perſon, and of his Sufferings. All which things clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhew, that the ſpiritual Change whereof he ſpeaks is a Change of Uſe and of Vertue; to import that the Bread and Wine are changed, by the Grace of Conſecration, into the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; as St. <hi>Iſidore</hi> of <hi>Sevil, Bede</hi> and <hi>Rabanus</hi> hath taught: and alſo changed into its Efficacy and Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue,

But beſides theſe Witneſſes which have depoſed, there be ſome others whoſe Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies may conduce to the clearing the Subject we treat of; therefore we will make no difficulty to receive their Depoſitions beginning with <hi>Ahyto. Ahyto,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Baſle,</hi> was ſo famous for his Holineſs of Life, for the Light of his Doctrine, and for his Wiſdom in managing great and important Affairs, that <hi>Charle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main</hi> had a very particular kindneſs and eſteem for him: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon, in the Year 811. he ſent him Ambaſſador unto <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople,</hi> to treat of Peace with the Eaſtern Emperor; as the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of <hi>France, Eginhard,</hi> Author of the Life of <hi>Charlemain;</hi> the Annals of <hi>Fulda, Herman Contract,</hi> and others do teſtifie.

                     <hi>In the fifth place, the Prieſts ought to know what the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſm and of Confirmation is, and what the Myſtery of the Body and Blood of our Lord is; how a viſible Creature is ſeen in the ſame Myſteries, and nevertheleſs, inviſible Salvation is there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated for the Salvation of the Soul; the which is contained in Faith only. Ahito</hi> ſpeaketh of Baptiſm, and of the Euchariſt. He diſtinguiſheth in the one, and the other, the Sign, and the thing ſignified; and lays it down for certain, that in both of them alike, there is a viſible Creature, without making any diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Creature that is ſeen in the Euchariſt; and that which is
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:47504:213"/>ſeen in Baptiſm; it muſt needs be then of neceſſity, That as by the Creature which is ſeen in Baptiſm, he underſtands the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Water and Chriſm; ſo alſo by that which is ſeen in the Euchariſt, he underſtands the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine; and becauſe Baptiſm and the Euchariſt are two Sacraments of the New Teſtaments, Inſtituted by one Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and appointed to render us partakers of his Grace, <hi>Ahyto</hi> attributes unto them both the ſame effect, <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Communication of Eternal and Inviſible Salvation unto thoſe which receive both the one and the other of theſe Sacraments with Faith.

The better to underſtand of what import his ſilence is, 'tis to be obſerved, that <hi>Amalarius,</hi> of whom we have inſiſted already, had found ſomething amiſs in the Service of the Church of <hi>Lyons,</hi> which ſo offended <hi>Agobard,</hi> that he wrote a Book on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe againſt the four Books of <hi>Amalarius</hi> touching Eccleſiaſtical things: And he writes it with ſo high a reſentment, that Father <hi>Chifflet</hi> could have wiſhed he had wrote with more moderation; <hi>And that he had dipt his pen,
<note place="margin">Ep. ad Balu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zium Agobar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do praefixa.</note> after the example of his Predeceſſors, in the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, the Lamb without ſpot, truly meek and humble in Spirit.</hi> It is then very probable, that in the humour <hi>Agobard</hi> was, againſt <hi>Amalarius,</hi> he ſuffer'd nothing to paſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reproved, except what he thought not fit to be cenſured, and which he approved of himſelf: And indeed by reading his Book, it will plainly appear with what exactneſs he examines all that dropt from the Pen of his Adverſary: Now 'tis moſt certain, he cenſured not any of the paſſages which we alledged for proving that <hi>Amalarius</hi> was contrary to the Opinion of <hi>Paſchas;</hi> can it be believed this Man, ſo full of anger and revenge, and who wrote not his Book, but to cenſure thoſe of <hi>Amalarius,</hi> and yet touched not any of the teſtimonies whereof we ſpeak; if the belief of <hi>Amalarius</hi> had not been the belief of the Church, or if <hi>Agobard</hi> had not been of the ſame Opinion he was, on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the Euchariſt, how could it poſſible be, but that he
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:47504:214"/>would have cenſur'd what <hi>Amalarius</hi> ſaid. How could he have ſlipt ſo fair an occaſion to have diſcredited his Adverſary, as a Man that prevaricated from the belief of the Church upon one of the Capital Articles of our Religion; but further, he alledges theſe words of <hi>Amalarius,</hi> which we before cited, <hi>The Bread ſet upon the Altar, repreſents the Body of our Saviour ſpread upon the Croſs; the Wine and Water in the Cup, do ſhew the Sacraments which did flow from the ſide of our Saviour upon the Croſs:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Agobard. ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſ. Annal. cap. 21. p. 119.</note> but he doth not there apply one word of cenſure. What can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd from this conduct, but that they were both agreed upon this point? Now if from the conſideration of his ſilence, we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to that of his words, it is ſaid, we ſhall be confirmed in the belief of what hath been ſaid; for he teſtifies,
<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 13. p. 115.</note> 
                     <hi>That as there is but one Altar of the Church, ſo alſo there is one bread of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and one ſole Cup of his Blood.</hi> He diſtinguiſheth the Bread from the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Cup from his Blood; as he diſtinguiſheth the Altar from the Church where it is. Moreover he declares,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Church conſecrating by theſe words,</hi> (he ſpeaks of all the words of Inſtitution) <hi>according to the Tradition of the Apoſtles, the Myſtery of the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> he ſaith expreſly, <hi>that our Saviour ſaid unto his Diſciples,</hi> Take, and Eat you all of this: Words which the Deacon <hi>Florus</hi> borrowed of him, with thoſe that follow, as we obſerved not long ago, to prove, that what our Saviour commanded his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to take and eat, was <hi>Bread.</hi> This is what was ſaid of <hi>Agobard.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have already mentioned in the 7th Chapter of this ſecond Part, an Aſſembly of Biſhops of the Dioceſſes of <hi>Roan</hi> and of <hi>Rhemis</hi> at <hi>Creſſy,</hi> which furniſhed us with a Declaration of their belief; but becauſe they wrote in this ſame Century, the Hiſtory whereof we examine, it is juſt that we ſhould here inſert their teſtimony; <hi>David Blundel</hi> in his Expoſition of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, ſaid in Chap. 18.

                     <hi>The Peace having been concluded, and interchangeably ſigned by the King and the Count, with the Blood of the Euchariſt, Count</hi> Bernard <hi>came from</hi> Barcelonia, <hi>unto</hi> Tholouſe, <hi>and caſt himſelf at the King's feet in the Monaſtery of</hi> St. Saturnine, <hi>near</hi> Tholouſe. <hi>The King taking him with the left hand, as it were, to lift him up, he ſtabb'd his Dagger into his ſide with the other hand, and cruelly murthered him; not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being blamed for having violated Faith and Religion, nor without ſuſpition of Parricide; becauſe it was generally thought,</hi> Charles <hi>was Son to</hi> Bernard, <hi>alſo he reſembled him very much about the mouth, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture publiſhing thereby the Mothers Adultery.

This Teſtimony is ſo much the more authentick, as that it is grounded upon the mixture which was made of the conſecrated Wine with Ink; an action which the Chriſtians of thoſe times blamed not: yet it is evident that they would not have failed to condemn it as a great Crime, if they had believed that it was the real Blood of their Saviour. It is after this manner they interpret the thought of this Hiſtorian.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>A Continuation of the Hiſtory of the <hi>IX.</hi> Century; wherein the Dignities and Promotion of <hi>Heribold</hi> is diſcourſed of.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>ALthough the Teſtimony of good men ought alike to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered and admitted of; nevertheleſs, it muſt be granted, that there be ſome perſons that give greater credit unto that which they affirm; their extraordinary Merit, or the degree they are in above others, rendring it more authentick, or more worthy to be believed; which is moſt eſpecially done in matters of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, in regard whereof, there are ſometimes perſons to be found, whoſe Depoſitions turn the Balance, and do much ſupport the Opinion in whoſe favour they declare. I judge that <hi>Heribald,</hi> or <hi>Heribold,</hi> was of this number and quality; therefore we have reſerved a whole Chapter for him, to examine in the firſt place, the Dignities which he enjoyed in the Church, and then his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief upon the point of the Sacrament. As to the firſt Head, <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ribald,</hi> or <hi>Heribold</hi> (for the Writers of that Age give him indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently that Name) was a Biſhop, a Dignity which every body knows, is very conſiderable; and in fine, <hi>Meſſieurs de</hi> St.
<note place="margin">Gall. Chriſt. t. 2. p. 269.</note> 
                     <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha</hi> reckon him to be the 36th Biſhop of the Church of <hi>Auxerr;</hi> and do obſerve, that he was a perſon of good Quality, and very much eſteemed by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald, in whoſe Reign he flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. There is not any queſtion to be made, but his proper Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits were the Foundation of his Credit with this Prince.
<note place="margin">Lupus Ferrar. Ep. 19. &amp; 37.</note> Whence it is that <hi>Loup,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Ferriers,</hi> calls him, <hi>Moſt Excellent Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late;</hi> and ſpeaks of him as of a Man endowed with a <hi>ſublime and divine Spirit.</hi> But beſides the Dignity of Biſhop, it may be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected by the 37th Letter which <hi>Loup</hi> writ unto him, that he was alſo Principal Chaplain unto <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald. It is the Induction which is made by Monſieur <hi>Baluze,</hi> unto whom we are beholden for the laſt Edition of the Works of <hi>Loup,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Ferriers;</hi> and certainly he doth it with great reaſon: for by only carefully obſerving this Letter, one may perceive the marks of this Dignity in the perſon of <hi>Heribold.</hi> In the firſt place,
<note place="margin">Lupus Ferrar. Ep. 37.</note> 
                     <hi>Loup</hi> repreſents him unto us, as being intruſted with multiplicity of Affairs that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy him continually, from which he wiſhes him ſome eaſe, that he might have ſome time to ſpend in reading St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries upon the Prophets, whereof he ſent him a Copy before he had read it himſelf. I know that the Charge of Paſtor and Biſhop is attended with much trouble, when it is faithfully and
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:47504:216"/>conſcientiouſly diſcharged. Nevertheleſs, that continual atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and multiplicity of buſineſs ſpoken of by <hi>Loup,</hi> cannot be attributed unto the Office of a Biſhop. And what puts the thing out of queſtion is, that he calls this ſort of buſineſs, <hi>Publick Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs;</hi> that is to ſay, great and important. Buſineſs, in a word, which the chief Chaplains were wont to determine in the Princes Palace; as we ſhall ſee, and as Monſieur <hi>Baluze</hi> has obſerved in his Notes upon his Letters.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>Loup</hi> intimates this Dignity by theſe words; <hi>Officii clariſſimus gradus;</hi> which imports an illuſtrious Degree, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is ſublime and eminent. In fine, he congratulates him with the many Honours conferred upon him; <hi>Vos convenientibus cumu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latos congratulor honoribus.</hi> All which things tend only to deſign this eminent Dignity. And if we had not this Letter of the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot <hi>de Ferriers,</hi> we could not doubt but <hi>Heribold</hi> was Principal Chaplain, becauſe the Hiſtory of the Biſhops of <hi>Auxerr,</hi> which is in the firſt Tome of the Library of Father <hi>Labbe,</hi> ſaith ſo in plain terms; and ſpeaks of him as of an eloquent, wiſe and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect perſon, abounding in Vertues, and full of Probity. It was this <hi>Heribold</hi> which aſſiſted at the Council of <hi>Tours, Anno</hi> 849. But becauſe it is not ſufficient to know that <hi>Heribold</hi> was Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Chaplain unto <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald, unleſs we know wherein this high Office conſiſted; I hope the Reader will not be offended, if I here make ſome little Digreſſion to ſhew what the Dignity of Arch Chaplain was.</p>
                  <p>Under the ſecond Race of our Kings, there were two Pala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine Offices; that is to ſay, of the Palace, and of the King's Houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, which were the two chiefeſt Offices of the Crown: The one of which took cognizance of all things relating to ſpiritual matters, and the other of all things relating unto temporal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. The firſt was called <hi>Principal Chaplain, Arch Palatine, Chief Chaplain, Prelate of the Sacred Palace:</hi> and the other was called <hi>Count of the Palace;</hi> very different from thoſe Counts which were ſent into the Provinces to adminiſter Juſtice. Unto each of whoſe Juriſdiction there was commonly aſſigned the Extent of a Biſhop's Dioceſs. I ſpeak on purpoſe of the ſecond Race of our Kings, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I find indeed there were Counts of the Palace under the firſt Race,
<note place="margin">Hignon. in not. ad lib. 1. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culf. p. 288.</note> by what the late Monſieur <hi>Bignon</hi> ſaid in his Notes upon <hi>Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culf;</hi> where he inſtanceth an Example after what manner the Kings of the firſt Race did judge affairs: wherein mention is made of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dobella,</hi> Count of the Palace; and of <hi>Clothair,</hi> Son of <hi>Clovis</hi> the Second, and Grandſon of <hi>Dagobert.</hi> But as for Principal Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain, I find not any until the ſecond Race. Now, the better to know what was the power and privileges of theſe two Dignities,
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:47504:216"/>we muſt conſider what <hi>Adelard,</hi> near Relation of <hi>Charlemains,</hi> and Abbot of <hi>Gorby,</hi> doth inform us, in one of <hi>Hincmar,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Rheims</hi> his Letters; for he writes, that the Office of Principal Chaplain, and that of Count of the Palace,
<note place="margin">Hincmar. Ep. 3 c. 19. Edi. Mog.</note> were the two Principal Offices of the Kings Houſhold, <hi>That the former,</hi> that is to ſay the Apocriſary, <hi>who was called the Chief Chaplain or Governour of the Palace, had the charge, and took an account of all Eccleſiaſtical matters, and of all Church Officers; and the Count of the Palace, of all ſecular cauſes and things; ſo that neither Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical nor ſecular perſons, were permitted to trouble the King about their affairs, until they had firſt adviſed with theſe Officers, to ſee if their buſineſs merited to be mentioned unto the Prince; but if it was a buſineſs whereof the King ſhould take preſent cognizance, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the King to hear them honourably, patiently, and favourably, according to each perſons quality.</hi> And ſpeaking again of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical judgments, which appertained unto the Juriſdiction of the Principal Chaplain, which he deſigns by the word Apocriſary; <hi>He had care</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>of all that concerned Eccleſiaſtical matters,
<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 20.</note> as alſo of differences betwixt Prebends and Monks, and generally of all matters that were reported unto the Princes Palace, touching the affairs of the Clergy, the King taking Cognizance only of what his chief Chaplain could not fully determine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as the Count of the Palace judged of temporal matters in the Aſſembly of the Peers of the Realm, and of the Biſhops, as appears by this ancient Formulary in Mr. <hi>Bignon</hi>'s Notes above mentioned; ſo it is very likely, that the Arch Chaplain alſo judged of Eccleſiaſtical and Sacred things in the ſame Aſſembly; beſide, that he aſſiſted, and was preſent at all the Conſultations and Councils which were held in the King's Court, either touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publick or private matters. Its true, this Dignity was only temporary, and during the King's pleaſure that beſtowed it; therefore <hi>Loup</hi> Abbot of <hi>Ferriers,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lupus Ep. 97.</note> writes unto <hi>Halduin</hi> Abbot of St. <hi>Dennis,</hi> who was chief Chaplain unto <hi>Lewis</hi> the <hi>Debo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nair; We believe you will enjoy this Dignity for ſome time.</hi> And from thence he takes occaſion to exhort him to uſe it worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and to do Juſtice: And becauſe Biſhops are determined by their Flock, where to live, and that the Popes had already ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired great power in <hi>France, Princes</hi> did in ſome ſort deſire li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to withdraw them from their Churches,
<note place="margin">Concil. Franc. can. 55. t. 2. Concil.

In the main, This Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity was ſo eminent, that if an Abbot had it, he had the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency
<pb n="428" facs="tcp:47504:217"/>of Biſhops;
<note place="margin">Baluz. in not is ad Lup. p. 463. &amp; ad Agobard p. 73.

I will add unto all we have ſaid of this Dignity, two circumſtances, which I ſuppoſe will not be unwelcome to the Reader. One is, that it may be Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from the 7th Chapter of the Letter, which the Prelates aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at <hi>Creſſy,
<note place="margin">Concil. Cariſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ac. c. 7.</note> Anno</hi> 858. wrote unto <hi>Lewis</hi> King of <hi>Germany,</hi> that the Dignity of Principal Chaplains, decreaſed by little and little, that of Count of the Palace gaining upon it inſenſibly; which obliged thoſe Biſhops to move for the re-eſtabliſhing of it.
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:47504:217"/>The other is, that the Chronicle of <hi>Lauriſham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chron. Lauri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham. ad an. 805.</note> gives unto <hi>Egin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hard,</hi> Son in Law unto <hi>Charlemain,</hi> the Quality of Principal Chaplain. So that it may be ſaid, that at that time, the Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Chaplains were married, which nevertheleſs, I refer unto the Judgment of others, without interpoſing my own.</p>
                  <p>But having proved that <hi>Heribold</hi> was Principal Chaplain unto <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald, and ſhewn the importance of this Employment, we muſt ſay ſomething of his belief touching the matter where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of we treat.

                  </p>
                  <p>It is not then to be wondred at, that <hi>Rabanus</hi> dedicated his Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential unto him, wherein he hath left marks of this Doctrine; <hi>Peter Stuart</hi> who cauſed it to be Printed, giving notice, that <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>banus</hi> dedicated it unto <hi>Heribold</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auxerr;</hi> I know that Cardinal <hi>du Perron,</hi> who had an extraordinary Genius, and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other ſince following his ſteps, would make I know not what Sect of Stercoraniſts, whereof <hi>Heribold</hi> was chief; and whoſe Opinions were quite different from the Doctrine of thoſe called Calviniſts, to be adverſaries unto <hi>Paſchas;</hi> but to ſpeak freely what I think, I could wiſh, that great men would act after ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther manner; and that they would not inſiſt upon theſe ſorts of Cavils. There is here queſtion made of the Opinion of the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of <hi>Paſchas;</hi> Will Cardinal <hi>du Perron,</hi> and thoſe which follow this Fiction of his Brain, tell us better than <hi>Paſehas</hi> himſelf what their Opinion was? <hi>Paſchas</hi> told us in the foregoing Chapter, that thoſe People did not judge, as he did teach, That the Euchariſt was the Fleſh which was born of the holy Virgin; but the Figure and the Sacrament of that Fleſh; a Figure and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament filled with the Vertue and Efficacy of this Divine Fleſh; ſo that believing that the Bread remaining Bread after Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they alſo believed, that as to its ſubſtance and matter, part of it turned into our proper ſubſtance, for the nouriſhment of our Bodies; and the other part paſſed the way of our common Food; which is directly, to ſpeak plainly, the Opinion of thoſe, at this preſent called Calviniſts. Now if this Belief was Erronious, if this Opinion was Heretical, contrary unto that of the Church, and different from the Ancient belief of Chriſtians, is it proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,
<pb n="430" facs="tcp:47504:218"/>that King <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald would have choſen for his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Chaplain, by conſent of the Pope, and the Synods of his Kingdom; and that the Clergy of <hi>France</hi> would have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preſide over it, a man infected with ſuch an Opinion? Or, that <hi>Hinemar</hi> after his Death, ſhould call him a Biſhop of venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble memory: And that there ſhould be engraven on his Tomb, <hi>Here lyeth the Body of</hi> St. Heribold. I cannot think ſo; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that the Opinion of <hi>Heribold,</hi> and the other Adverſaries of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> which is the ſame of the Calviniſts, was the moſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Opinion in the IX. Century; and that that of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> which is followed by <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks at this time, was not approved at that time; but was oppoſed by all the great and learned Men of that Age.

                  <argument>
                     <p>A Continuation of the Hiſtory of the IX. Century; wherein is examined the ſilence of the two Popes, <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Firſt, and <hi>Adrian</hi> the Second; with two Obſervations touching the Greek Church.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>IT is a thing very worthy to be obſerved, and which deſerves ſerious conſideration, that the Popes <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Firſt, and <hi>Adrian</hi> the Second; having been Spectators of ſo obſtinate a combate, without engaging on either ſide; and having been ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in a time when they ought to ſpeak: and ſeen Mens minds divided, although unequally, upon the ſubject of the Sacrament; yet after all, declared not themſelves in favour of the one ſide or the other; and it doth not appear that they open'd their mouths either to condemn or approve either of the two Opinions. So that if the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks do ſay, that they condemned not their Doctrine in the perſon of <hi>Paſchas;</hi> the Proteſtants can alſo affirm, That they pronounced no ſentence againſt their Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, in the perſons of his Adverſaries; which were incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more famous both in number and quality, than the followers of <hi>Paſchas;</hi> becauſe, that inſtead of one or two at the moſt, (at leaſt that is come to our knowledge, which followed him) we have heard the teſtimonies of Sixteen; the Principal Chaplain, Biſhops, Archbiſhops, Abbots and others, which in that Age, oppoſed themſelves directly or indirectly unto his Opinion, as
<pb n="431" facs="tcp:47504:218"/>being contrary unto the Belief which untill that time, had been generally received in the Church. But if after what hath been ſaid, the Latin Church ſhall continue to teach, that the Belief of Proteſtants, which we have proved to be that of the Adverſaries of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> was at that time eſteemed erroneous; then it muſt neceſſarily follow, ſay they, that ſhe confeſs that <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Firſt and <hi>Adrian</hi> the Second may juſtly be ſuſpected to be guilty there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of,
<note place="margin">Decret. Grat. diſt. 82. c. Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Leo. I. Ep. 93. c. 15.</note> according to this Maxim of the Law inſerted by <hi>Gratian</hi> in his Decree; <hi>That one approves the Error whereunto he makes no op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition:</hi> And according unto what is ſaid by <hi>Leo</hi> the Firſt, <hi>That he which recalls not a Man from his Error, ſheweth that he erreth himſelf.</hi> And if on the other hand, ſhe affirms that the Doctrine of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> which is hers, was at that time acknowledged to be Catholick and Orthodox, and the publick Doctrine of the Church, ſhe would tacitly accuſe theſe two Popes for having ſuppreſſed it, as Adverſaries and Enemies, according unto what is contained in the ſame Maxim of the Law before alledged;
<note place="margin">Decret. Grat. ubi ſupra.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Truth is ſuppreſſed when it is not defended.</hi> For to imagine that <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> had not knowledge of this great Conteſt, cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be ſaid. The thing had made too great a noiſe for them to be ignorant of it. Had there been indeed only bare verbal Diſputes, this pretext might have ſome colour; but there having been Books written on either part, and ſome of them having been compoſed by Order and Command of a King of <hi>France,</hi> it is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing probable that the Apoſtolical See ſhould be wholly igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the matter, under <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Firſt, and <hi>Adrian</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. Wherefore then may it be ſaid, Did they not take part? Wherefore did they not declare either for <hi>Paſchas,</hi> or for his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries? Wherefore had they not condemned the one, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected the others? If the Doctrine of <hi>Paſchas</hi> had been the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Doctrine of the Church, why did they not authorize it by their Approbations? And wherefore did they not thunder out their Cenſures againſt that of his Adverſaries? Or if the Belief of his Adverſaries were the ancient Belief of Chriſtians, wherefore did they not encourage it by their Power? And why did they not Anathematize the Novelty of <hi>Paſchas?</hi> This difficulty de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be carefully enquired into, there being not many De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrations to reſolve it, but only ſeveral Conjectures and Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, which I refer unto the Judgment of thoſe that ſhall take the pains of reading this Treatiſe.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid then in the firſt place, that although we have not po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively ſaid, that <hi>Paſchas</hi> proceeded by way of Explication, yet we have made appear, that in all likelihood it was the way he took, not to irritate Mens Minds in propoſing his Opinion.</p>
                  <pb n="432" facs="tcp:47504:219"/>
                  <p>Secondly, that <hi>Paſchas</hi> his Party had no Followers during the IX. Century; as hath been already proved. So that having but a very few, it remained, very probably, incloſed in the Cloiſters of ſome Friars which he might have gained unto his Party; wherein it hid it ſelf from the many oppoſitions which it found, until ſome more favourable time ſhould preſent, to advance and eſtabliſh it ſelf in the World. And in fine, that the Belief of his Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries had the Victory and Advantage in this Age; being generally received and practiſed in all the Weſt. <hi>Nicholas</hi> then, and after him <hi>Adrian,</hi> conſidering that the Opinion of <hi>Paſchas</hi> was oppoſed by the moſt eminent Men of that Age, that it had no Followers nor Adherents; and that after all the Oppoſition it found in its firſt Eſtabliſhment, it would not do any prejudice unto the other, they very judiciouſly believed that it was the wiſeſt courſe to let it fall of it ſelf, and to refer unto time the utter ruin of it; there being no likelihood that being ſo powerfully oppoſed as it was, it ſhould ever do any harm: whereas, ſhould they have ſet about cenſuring and condemning it publickly, it might be feared leſt it might recover ſtrength; becauſe 'tis often ſeen, that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons grow ſtubborn againſt Reproofs; and more earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the things that are forbidden, uſe their utmoſt skill and power to obtain the Enjoyment. Theſe, as is ſuppoſed, were the reaſons and motives of the Conduct of theſe two Popes in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Opinion of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> in not condemning him publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, although they did not alſo approve of him.</p>
                  <p>But it was not ſo of the other Opinion; for they plainly did ſee that the Belief of the Enemies of <hi>Paſchas</hi> was a Belief pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly received by all the World; in <hi>France,</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and elſewhere; and moreover, approved by the moſt learned Men of the Age, publickly vindicated by Writings, ſupported by the Authority of the moſt eminent Princes and Prelates. They could not then be ignorant of the danger the Church was in, if this Belief were not Catholick, nor this Doctrine Orthodox: And not being ignorant of it, it had been Charity, and the duty alſo of <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>Adrian</hi> to have taken notice of it, and to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed it; for the caſe was not of two or three Friars which <hi>Paſchas</hi> had drawn unto his Opinion; but of the greateſt part of the Weſt, which was over-ſpread with the Opinion of his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries. Had it been an Heretical and Heterodox Opinion, and a Doctrine contrary unto the Faith of the Church, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid but theſe Popes had Credit and Power enough to have oppoſed themſelves. For beſides, that every body knows the Popes had already acquired great Power over the Weſtern Churches, wherein they eaſily cauſed their Conſtitutions to be
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:47504:219"/>received; the Biſhops not daring much to oppoſe the Execution of their Decrees, although they found them not always agreeable unto the ancient Canons. Beſides this, I ſay, who knows not but they might at leaſt have proteſted againſt ſo pernicious an Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, have oppoſed what they could unto its Settlement, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly exhorted the Prelates to ſtop the courſe and progreſs of ſo dangerous a Doctrine, to have uſed <hi>Anathema</hi>'s and Excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations againſt the Promoters of it, thereby to have diſcouraged others. Yet nevertheleſs, it is moſt certain they did no ſuch thing. Is it not then a manifeſt ſign that they themſelves were of this Belief, and that they acknowledged that this Doctrine is the very ſame whereof the Church had ever been in peaceable Poſſeſſion, until <hi>Paſchas</hi> came to diſturb her in the Enjoyment of her Paternal Inheritance. Theſe are the Inferences made by Proteſtants, from the Silence of theſe two Popes.</p>
                  <p>They ſay, the thing will appear yet plainer, if we conſider the temper of <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Firſt, and the occaſions he had; as alſo <hi>Adrian</hi> the Second, to take notice of the Doctrine of the Adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries of <hi>Paſchas. Nicholas</hi> the Firſt was a learned Man for that Age, a daring and undertaking Man, who very much advanced the Dignity of his See, unto the prejudice of other Churches. <hi>France</hi> felt the effects of his Policy and Power, in that he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Right of aſſembling Councils, which the Kings were wont to do before; that he gave a very great Aſſault unto the little power that its Prelates had remaining, and that he began to make them receive the Decretals of the firſt Popes, which had been forged by ſome Impoſtor about the time of <hi>Charlemain.</hi> 'Tis on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to read what the late Monſieur <hi>de Marca</hi> hath ſaid in his Books of the Liberties of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church,
<note place="margin">Marca de con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord l. 3. c. 5, 6. &amp; l. 6. c. 28. &amp; l. 7. c. 23.</note> to ſee what kind of a perſon <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Firſt was, and what Attempts he made againſt the Prelates of <hi>France</hi> and their Synods. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, I do not find that ever he touched the point of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt; although he had occaſion either to have reproved their ſhameful Compliance, or their Error. For example, In the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference he had with the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> firſt upon account of <hi>Walfad,</hi> and ſome other Clerks, which had been eſtabliſhed by <hi>Ebbo</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheims,</hi> after his Depoſition and Re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, which was no way Canonical, and whoſe Ordination was eſteemed void in a Council of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> in the Year 853. And ſecondly, upon the Subject of <hi>Rothard</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> who had been depoſed by the French Prelates. <hi>Nicholas</hi> informing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of both theſe matters, and forcing our Biſhops to comply with his deſires, even to the prejudice of their Liberties, and of their remaining Authority; as thoſe know very well that have any
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:47504:220"/>knowledge of the Hiſtory of thoſe times, without reciting here the particularities of it. It need only be ſaid, That if the Belief of <hi>Nicholas</hi> upon the point of the Sacrament, had been different from that of the Adverſaries of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> it is likely that theſe two Conjunctures of matters had offered him two fair occaſions of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching them; That as they made no difficulty of breaking the Canons in depoſing of Clerks and Biſhops, for they thought ſo, otherwiſe he could have had no pretext for re-eſtabliſhing of them; ſo alſo, they feared not violating the Rule of Faith, in ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a point as is that of the Sacrament, either in embracing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a new Belief, or in ſuffering it to get ground, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the ancient Doctrine of the Church, which <hi>Paſchas</hi> had clearly explained. Is it likely that Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> who was a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry learned, politick and prudent Man, ſhould have forgot to have made them this Reproach in the differences he had with them, thereby to have loaden them with ſhame; and with the more plauſible ſhew of Juſtice, to have deprived them of their Rights and Privileges, in ſhewing unto all the World, that they had made themſelves unworthy of them, becauſe they ſee the ancient Faith of Chriſtians ruined, without making any oppoſition, by the eſtabliſhing of a new Doctrine, which inſinuated it ſelf into the minds of all Men, and which was already generally received in all places? It cannot be believed, <hi>Nicholas</hi> would have been ſilent in theſe occaſions, if the Opinion of <hi>Paſchas</hi> had been the firſt Belief of the Church, and that of his Adverſaries a new Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, which they endeavoured to ſettle in the place of the Old.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, we have made appear in the precedent Chapter, that <hi>Heribold,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Auxerr,</hi> was Principal Chaplain unto <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald; that he could not be ſo, without the conſent, not only of the Synod, but alſo of the Pope; that is, either of <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> the Firſt, or of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Second: for in all likelihood, it muſt have been under one or the other of them. And, in fine; that he had an Opinion contrary unto <hi>Paſchas,</hi> upon the Subject of the Euchariſt, and agreeable unto that of the Proteſtants. Is it probable, ſay ſome, that <hi>Nicholas</hi> or <hi>Adrian</hi> would have ſuffered <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald to make choice of <hi>Heribold</hi> for his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Chaplain, if his Opinion had been an Heretical and Hetero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox Opinion, an Opinion contrary to the Belief of the Church, as well as unto that of <hi>Adrian,</hi> and of <hi>Nicholas?</hi> But beſides, whilſt <hi>Nicholas</hi> held the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> there are aroſe a great Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt betwixt the Greek and Latin Churches, betwixt <hi>Nicholas</hi> and <hi>Photius,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople. Nicholas</hi> ſued for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Biſhops of <hi>France,</hi> to defend the Latins againſt the Greeks. The French Prelates made choice of <hi>Bertram,</hi> or <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramn;</hi>
                     <pb n="435" facs="tcp:47504:220"/>who by their Order, undertook the Defence of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Church againſt the Greek: and in the four Books he wrote, and which are now extant, refuted the Accuſations of the Greeks againſt the Latins. This <hi>Ratramn,</hi> I ſay, which by order of King <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald, compoſed a Treatiſe of the Body and Blood of Chriſt; wherein he plainly oppoſeth the Doctrine of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> and doth eſtabliſh that of his Adverſaries. Is it likely, ſay many, that if the Belief of <hi>Ratramn</hi> had not been the Belief of the Church, that the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> would have made choice of him to have defended the Intereſt of the Latins, againſt the Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of the Greeks: or if the French Prelates, perſuaded of the ſame Belief, made no difficulty to make choice of <hi>Ratramn;</hi> could it be imagined, <hi>Nicholas</hi> would have approved this Choice, if he had been of another Perſuaſion in this Eſſential Point of Religion? I know that <hi>Nicholas</hi> wrote unto <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald, deſiring he would ſend him the Latin Tranſlation of the Hierarchy of the pretended <hi>Dennis</hi> the <hi>Arcopagite,</hi> made by <hi>John Erigenius;</hi> who alſo wrote of the Sacrament by Order of the ſame Prince, but after the ſame manner as is written by Proteſtant Doctors: And that this Pope alledges for a reaſon, that though this <hi>John</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be very learned, nevertheleſs it was ſaid,
<note place="margin">Nicolaus I. t. 3. Concil. Gall. p. 352. ex Ivone.</note> 
                     <hi>That he had not formerly good Opinions of certain things;</hi> but thoſe things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned not the Euchariſt: for it is not probable, <hi>Nicholas</hi> would have ſpoke ſo coldly, if theſe ill Opinions of <hi>John</hi> had been upon the Subject of the Sacrament. Beſides, he would not have failed to have demanded what he had written, either to have condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or approved it, as he intended to do of the Tranſlation of the Works of <hi>Denis</hi> the <hi>Arcopagite:</hi> And he would have demanded it ſo much the more earneſtly, as that there was more to be feared by the one, than the other; I mean, by what he had written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Subject of the Euchariſt, than of his Tranſlation of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended <hi>Denis</hi> the <hi>Arcopagite.</hi> Add unto all this, that if any ill reports had been publiſhed of <hi>John,</hi> touching the Subject of the Sacrament, it had been by reaſon of the Adverſaries which his ill choice upon the Point of Predeſtination had ſtirred him up: yet nevertheleſs, it is certain, they never taxed him to have erred in this point. It muſt then be concluded, that the ill Opinions men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and whereof the Report came unto him, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the matter of Predeſtination, whereupon <hi>John Erigenius</hi> ſuffered himſelf to be led away unto ungrounded and empty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions, which were aggravated with ſome heat by the learned Church of <hi>Lions,</hi> by <hi>Florus</hi> its Deacon, by <hi>Prudens</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Troys,</hi> and by the Councils of <hi>Valentia</hi> and of <hi>Langres:</hi> Yet theſe Adverſaries, incenſed againſt him, never accuſed him of any ill
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:47504:221"/>Opinion touching the Sacrament; from whence it is concluded, That his Doctrine in this point (directly oppoſite unto that of <hi>Paſchas</hi>) was the true Doctrine of the Church: Therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Nicholas</hi> the firſt, nor any of his Succeſſors, did condemn it, until <hi>Leo</hi> the Ninth, who condemned his Book to be burnt at the Council of <hi>Verſeil, anno</hi> 1050. where <hi>Berengarius</hi> was alſo condemned. I know alſo that the ſame <hi>Nicholas,</hi> ſpeaking of the vertue of Conſecration, and of what it operates in the things which are Conſecrated and Sanctified, alledges for examples, the Altar, the Croſs, the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt; and that he obſerves, that the Altar, which naturally is but a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Stone; and that differs not from others, becomes by the Benediction, the Holy Table; That the Image of the Croſs, which is but common Wood before it receives this form, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes holy and terrible unto Devils,

                  <p>And what is ſaid of the proceedings of <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Firſt, is alſo affirmed of <hi>Adrian</hi> the Second, whoſe ſilence in moſt of the things ſpoken of Pope <hi>Nicholas,</hi> and which we pretend not to repeat over again, doth evidently prove, that he, no more then his Predeceſſor, did not condemn the Doctrine of the Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of <hi>Paſchas.</hi> I will only add, that in the hot conteſt which <hi>Adrian</hi> had with the Biſhops of <hi>France</hi> upon account of <hi>Hincmar</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Laon,</hi> he never taxeth them with any thing touching the Sacrament; and what makes the thing the more conſiderable is, that <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald having interpoſed in the quarrel, as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tector of the Cannons, and of the Authority of the Prelates of his Kingdom, Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> commanded him to ſend <hi>Hincmar</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> condemned by the judgment of the <hi>Gallican</hi> Church; which ſo highly diſpleaſed the King, that he made him a very ſharp anſwer, wherein he tells him, amongſt
<pb n="437" facs="tcp:47504:221"/>other things, that the Kings of <hi>France</hi> born of Royal Blood,

He demands what Hell had ſpewed out a Law, that ſhould impoſe upon Princes; and out of what dark Cave it proceeded. He warns him not to direct any commands unto him for the future, nor threats of Excommunication contrary to the holy Scriptures, the Doctrine of the Ancients, the Imperial Conſtitutions, and Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Canons. He deſires he would write him no more ſuch Letters, nor to the Biſhops and great Lords of his Kingdom; leſt they ſhould be forced to reject them with ſcorn, and affront his Meſſengers; inſomuch, as he threatens him with Depoſition, or of Anathematizing, according to the Decree of the Fifth Univerſal Council. There are ſeveral other things of the like Nature in the Letter, which is not neceſſary to be mention'd: What hath been ſaid, ſufficeth to ſhew, that Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> could not wiſh a fairer occaſion to tax <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald, as Protector of the Doctrine of the Adverſaries of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tramn</hi> and <hi>John Erigenius</hi> wrote by his command; not to ſpeak of his Principal Chaplain <hi>Heribold,</hi> which was of the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion: <hi>Adrian</hi> doth no ſuch thing. On the contrary, he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to appeaſe the ſpirit of <hi>Charles,</hi> in the Letter which he af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter wrote to him; and to mitigate the anger which the firſt had provoked him unto: wherein he had commanded him with Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, to ſend <hi>Hincmar</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Laon</hi> unto <hi>Rome.</hi> It is ſaid, that theſe proceedings do in all likelihood juſtifie, that the belief of <hi>Ratramn</hi> and of <hi>John Erigenius,</hi> whom the King Protected, was the belief of <hi>Adrian</hi> himſelf, and of the whole Church; it not being to be believed, the Pope would have been ſilent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this Prince, who had ſo touched him to the Quick, if the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine which he favoured, had not been Catholick and Orthodox.</p>
                  <p>I would here conclude the Hiſtory of the IX.

                  <argument>
                     <p>Of the <hi>State</hi> of the <hi>X. Century.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Tenth Age hath exerciſed of late years, two good Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and hath afforded matter and ſubject unto Authors, which with much skill and induſtry (each defending the cauſe of his party) grappled a long time about this poor Age, either to advance the credit of it, or to ſhew the moroſity, ignorance, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of it; they both ſpoke very agreeably what they intended to ſay; and having thereupon reflected ſharply upon each other, in the view of all <hi>France,</hi> have not as yet decided their Controverſie. If I miſtake not, every body may ſee that I mean the Author of the <hi>Perpetuity of the Faith of the Euchariſt,</hi> and him that anſwered him: The former having made a ſhort Diſcourſe, which was to ſerve for a Preface unto the Office of the Holy Sacrament, had not ſome reaſons hindred the execution of this firſt deſign. The latter, at the deſire of ſome Godly Friends, undertook to make ſome Conſiderations upon this little Treatiſe; and having in brief ſpoken of the X. Century, as of an unfortunate, ignorant Age, overſpread with Darkneſs and Errors, according to the teſtimony of Hiſtorians. The Author of the Perpetuity, hath inſiſted upon this part of the conſiderations of his Adverſary; and hath employed all his endeavours to reſtore unto this Age, all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and Glory that he thought it had been unjuſtly deprived of; accuſing the Miniſters of diſparaging it for intereſt ſake. The other was not ſilent, but having fully vindicated his Brethren from the Accuſation laid to their charge; he proves by ſeveral Hiſtorians, and of perſons the moſt affectionate to the Latin Church, That it was a Leaden Age, an Iron, and unhappy Age, an Age of Darkneſs, Ignorance, Superſtition, and Obſcurity: whereas his Adverſary eſteems it to be an Age of Light, an Age of Grace and Benediction. For my particular, although I know that he which eſteems it an Age of Darkneſs, is ſupported by the Authority of all, or at leaſt, the greateſt number of Hiſtorians which have written of it, eſpecially of <hi>Baronius, Gennebrard,</hi> and <hi>Bellarmine:</hi> and that ſo far he hath not ſaid any thing of his own: And that the reaſons of his Adverſary, which repreſents it as an Age of Learning and Benediction, do not appear unto me of ſufficient force to invalidate what he hath eſtabliſhed upon the report of Hiſtorians: I will however make a third party in this rencounter, and hold the mean betwixt theſe two extreams;
<pb n="440" facs="tcp:47504:223"/>I ſay, that I will not abſolutely follow the Hiſtorians, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent it wholly dark and ignorant; nor the Author of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuity, which repreſents it all light and glorious: For if I do not make it an Age wholly Light, neither will I eſteem it to be wholly Darkneſs: If I judge it not to be an Age of Grace, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I conceive it to be one altogether unfortunate: If it appear not unto me to be wholly an Age of Benediction, neither doth it appear to be only an Age of Malediction. In a word, if I look not upon it to be an Age of <hi>Hillary's,</hi> of <hi>Athanaſius's,</hi> of <hi>Baſills,</hi> of <hi>Gregory's,</hi> and of <hi>Ambroſes;</hi> or as an Age of <hi>Chriſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms,</hi> of <hi>Jeromes,</hi> and of <hi>Auſtins;</hi> yet I do not regard it as an Age of <hi>Bareletes,</hi> of <hi>Maillards,</hi> and of <hi>Menots.</hi> I do not liken it unto a fair Summers day, when the Heavens being free from Clouds, the Sun ſhineth in its full force, and communicates un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, without any Obſtruction, his Light and Heat; but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Winters day, which being dark, and the Air full of thick Clouds, deprives us of the ſight of the Sun, yet not totally of its Light; ſo that we have ſtill left us ſufficient to direct us, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it may not be always enough to hinder us from ſtumbling. In like manner ſay ſome, during the X. Century; the Sins of Men having made a thick Cloud betwixt the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and them, he communicated not unto them fully the Light of his healthful Beams, although he imparted unto them ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to avoid the Errors which cannot be believed without Ruin, and to embrace the Truth, the knowledge whereof is neceſſary to Salvation. What likelihood, ſay ſome, is there, that having ſhed forth ſo much Light upon the IX. Century, for the defence of the Truth, that Men ſhould, on a ſuddain, be plunged into Darkneſs: But what likelihood is there alſo, that the ſame Cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, with the ſame freedom, ſhould be continued to be diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed unto Men, when it was ſeen that they began to abuſe them; and that the Fleſh gaining, by little and little, the Victory over the Spirit, they degenerated inſenſibly from the truth of their Belief, and the purity of their Devotion. Nevertheleſs, as God is infinitely good, and that he never leaves himſelf without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of doing good unto Men, however unthankful and ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful they be; ſo if he diſpenſed not ſufficient Knowledge unto the Men of the X. Century, to oppoſe the Opinion of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> with the ſame vigour as it was oppoſed in the IX. yet he diſpenſed them ſo much, as to hinder it from being eſtabliſhed all that Age; as ſhall be ſhewed in the progreſs of this Hiſtory. But in the firſt place, it will be neceſſary to relate what is ſaid by <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury,</hi>

<pb n="441" facs="tcp:47504:223"/>doubted of the truth of the Body of our Lord, that he ſhewed them the Bread of the Altar changed into Fleſh, and the Wine of the Cup chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Blood; and afterwards he made them return unto their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral form, and rendred them proper for the life of Men.</hi> This is the only Author of the X. Century that is come to our knowledge, which publickly declared himſelf for the Opinion of <hi>Paſchas;</hi> whereas the Hiſtorian's Relation ſheweth, that there were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral that were of a contrary Judgment, and who had no ſmall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to profeſs it openly: beſides, the method of this Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late, to make them receive his Opinion, ſeems unto many, to be but a ſtory made at random, either by <hi>Odo</hi> himſelf, or by the Friar which wrote the Hiſtory of it; and they heartily wiſh that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians would not uſe theſe kind of Prodigies, to prove the truth of the Doctrines of their Religion; ſaying, that Unbelievers are diſ-ſatisfied, and thoſe which believe, and are enlightned, and that are pious, can receive no Edification thereby. And they make no queſtion but that <hi>Paſchas</hi> rendred his Doctrine ſuſpici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto moſt perſons, by the pretended Miracles that he made uſe of to eſtabliſh it; becauſe this kind of proceeding ſhewed plainly, that he found neither in the Scriptures, nor Traditions, Reaſons ſtrong enough to defend it, ſeeing he had recourſe unto theſe prodigious Apparitions. But whatever this Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> could do for the promoting the Doctrine of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> his endeavours had not all the ſucceſs he could have wiſhed; the contrary Doctrine which had been ſo well planted in this Kingdom, until the Year 883. by <hi>John Erige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius,</hi> one of the greateſt Adverſaries of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> there continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtill, and being publickly preached.

He adds, <hi>That the Bread is his Body, as the Manna; and the Wine his Blood, as the Water of the Deſert was.</hi> If this Sermon was one of <hi>Wulfin</hi>'s, according to the Title, the Year 840. as we have computed it, doth not ill agree with it? But if it be <hi>Alfric</hi>'s, we muſt deſcend lower, towards the end of the X. Century.

<pb n="442" facs="tcp:47504:224"/>for us, nor his Blood which he ſhed; but it is made ſpiritually his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood; as the Manna which fell from Heaven, and the Water which flowed from the Rock.</hi> If theſe two Sermons are of two ſeveral Authors, we have already two Witneſſes directly contrary unto the Doctrine of <hi>Paſchas;</hi> who taught that the Euchariſt was no other Fleſh but that which was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and which ſuffered upon the Croſs. But in theſe two Sermons the people are taught, that it is not the ſame Fleſh, nor the ſame Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy which ſuffered, nor the ſame Blood which was ſhed for us. You cannot but think thoſe that ſaid ſo were oppoſite unto <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas,</hi> and endeavoured to ruin his Belief; and it may be alſo, that of <hi>Odo</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> if it be true that he did what <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> wrote a long while after; for there be a great many that think this Relation is very ſuſpicious. In the main, Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> obſerves that the words which were but now al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in the laſt Teſtimony, have been ſtolen away by ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious hand, from the Manuſcript which was tranſported from the Church of <hi>Vigorn,</hi> into the Library of the <hi>Benedictines</hi> Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege at <hi>Cambridge.</hi> But beſides theſe two Witneſſes, which ſhew what was believed of the Sacrament in <hi>England,</hi> there is to be ſeen a Sermon which was read unto the people every Year at <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> to preſerve in their minds an <hi>Idea</hi> of the Belief which their Fathers had left them: It is needleſs to tranſcribe it here at large; ſome parts of it ſhall ſuffice; which ſhewing that it was almoſt copied out of the Treatiſe of <hi>Ratramn,</hi> of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, they will by the ſame means ſhew, that it contains a Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine oppoſite unto that of <hi>Paſchas,</hi>

Anglo-Sax. &amp; Latin.</note> ſeeing <hi>Ratramn</hi> was one of his declared Enemies. <hi>There is great difference,</hi> ſaith this Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>betwixt the Body wherein Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered, and the Body which is conſecrated for the Euchariſt; for the Body wherein Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered, is born of the Fleſh of</hi> Mary, <hi>and is furniſhed with Blood, Bones, Skin, Nerves, and Humane Members, and with a reaſonable Soul; but his ſpiritual Body, which we call Euchariſt, is compoſed of ſeveral Grains, without Blood, without Bones and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and without a Soul. The Body of Jeſus Chriſt which ſuffered death, and which roſe again, ſhall never die any more; it is eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, and cannot die: but this Euchariſt is temporal, not eternal; it is corruptible, and divided into ſeveral parts; broken by the teeth, and goeth into the draft. This Sacrament is a Pledge and a Figure; the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is the truth it ſelf: We hold this Pledge ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentally, until we do attain unto the Truth, and then the Pledge ſhall be accompliſhed.</hi> And a little before, <hi>If we conſider the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt in a corporal manner, we ſee that it is a corruptible and fading Creature; but if we conſider the ſpiritual vertue which is therein, we
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:47504:224"/>know very well that there is life in it, and that it gives immortality unto thoſe which which receive it with Faith. There is great diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence between the inviſible vertue of this holy Sacrament, and the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible form of its proper Nature: by Nature it is fading Bread, and corruptible Wine; but by the vertue of the Word of God, it is truly his Body, and his Blood; not for all that corporally, but ſpiritually; that is to ſay, in vertue, and in efficacy.</hi> Whereunto amounts what is ſaid before. <hi>The Bread and Wine which the Prieſts do conſecrate,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> do outwardly offer one thing unto the eyes of the Body, and another thing inwardly unto the eyes of the faithful Soul: outwardly it is plainly ſeen it is Bread and Wine, and it is judged to be ſuch by its form, and by its ſavour; and nevertheleſs, they be truly after Conſecration, his Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and Blood, by a ſpiritual Sacrament.</hi> And to the end the Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould be well perſuaded they were the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, not in ſubſtance, but in vertue, the Change which happens unto the Bread and Wine by Conſecration, is compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto that which comes unto Children by Baptiſm, and unto the Water of this Sacrament of our Regeneration.
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>The Child of a Gentile is baptized; yet it doth not change its outward form, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it be changed inwardly: It is led unto the Font full of ſin, by the diſobedience of</hi> Adam; <hi>and he is cleanſed from all inwardly, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he is nothing changed outwardly. So alſo the Water of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, which is called the Fountain of Life, in appearance is like unto other Waters, and ſubject unto Corruption; but the vertue of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt intervenes by Prayer, unto this corruptible Water; and by a ſpiritual vertue, renders it fit to cleanſe the Body and Soul from all ſin. Now we conſider two things in this only Creature; according to its true nature, it is a corruptible Water; but according to the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual myſtery, it hath a ſaving vertue. It is well ſaid, that Jeſus Chriſt did change, by an inviſible power, the Bread and Wine into his Body and Blood; but after the ſame manner that formerly he changed the Manna, and the Water of the Rock;</hi> into this ſame Body, and and into this ſame Blood; to wit, becauſe he made it the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Body and of his Blood. And again,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>What there is in the Sacrament that gives life, proceeds from a ſpiritual Vertue, and an inviſible Operation; therefore the Euchariſt is called a Sacrament, becauſe one thing is therein ſeen, and another thing is underſtood: that which is ſeen, is of a bodily Species; that which is underſtood, hath a ſpiritual Vertue.</hi> And in another part of the Sermon, expound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what Jeſus Chriſt ſaid of eating his Fleſh, in the 6th of St. <hi>John; He commanded not to eat the Body which he had taken,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> nor to drink the Blood which he had ſhed for us: but by this diſcourſe he meant the Sacrament, which is ſpiritually his Body and Blood: for whoſoever eateth him with a believing heart, ſhall have this Life everlaſting.
<pb n="444" facs="tcp:47504:225"/>Under the Old Law, Believers offered Sacrifices, which repreſented the Body which Jeſus Chriſt offered unto his Father for our ſins: but as for the Sacrament which is conſecrated at the Altar of God, it is the Commemoration of the Body which he offered, and of the Blood which he ſhed for us; as he himſelf commanded, ſaying,</hi> Do this in remembrance of me. I am not ignorant that in this ſame Homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is ſome miraculous Apparitions made mention of, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto Chriſtians had given ſome way, ſince <hi>Paſchas</hi> his time. But that ſerves only to confirm the Obſervation that was made, <hi>That although our Saviour had beſtowed upon his Servants in the X. Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury Light ſufficient to avoid the moſt dangerous Errors, yet he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated not ſo great a meaſure unto them, as to be ſafe from all ſorts of Surpriſes in matters of Religion.</hi>

                  <p>If from <hi>England,</hi> we paſs into the Country of <hi>Liege,</hi> we ſhall there find <hi>Folcuin,</hi> Abbot of the Monaſtery of <hi>Lobes;</hi> who ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Euchariſtical Table,

But that hinders not, that in collecting againſt him the Paſſages and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies of the holy Fathers, upon the Subject of the Sacrament, he declared that he did not approve of his Opinion; for Juſtice ought indeed to be done unto the Merit of the perſon, even of our greateſt Enemies; and it was a great honour unto <hi>Herriger</hi> to write againſt a Man, unto whom he gave ſo great Commendati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; at leaſt, if <hi>Molanus</hi> his Author ſaith true; for he thereby
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:47504:225"/>ſhewed, that it was only Love of the Truth which made him take Pen in hand againſt a Man whoſe Memory he honoured,

The Author of the Cuſtoms of the Abbots of <hi>Gembloux,</hi> near <hi>Namur,</hi> ſpeaks alſo much in his praiſe, in the ſame Tome of <hi>Dom Luke d'Achery.

This great familiarity,
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 591.593.</note> joyned with a ſtrict ſociety in reading, and the underſtanding of the holy Scriptures, gives, if I miſtake not, a ſufficient evidence that they were both of one Opinion upon the point of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but an Opinion contrary unto that of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> againſt whom <hi>Herriger</hi> aſſembled ſeveral Teſtimonies of the holy Fathers. And as what I have now related is but a Conjecture, ſo I leave it unto the Reader's liberty to think and ſay what he pleaſe, whilſt I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to continue the Hiſtory of the X.

                  <p>In the beginning of this Century the Congregation of <hi>Cluny</hi> was inſtituted, <hi>Anno</hi> 910. by the Foundation of <hi>William,</hi>

Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly they elected <hi>Odo</hi> after the deceaſe of <hi>Bernon;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tom. 4.

Century, that the Friar <hi>Ulrick</hi> digeſted into a Body the Cuſtoms of this Monaſtery. <hi>Caſſander</hi> ſaw them in a fair Manuſcript, and drew a paſſage out of them for the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion under both Kinds, as hath been obſerved in the firſt part; but ſix or ſeven years ago, they were printed by the care of <hi>Dom Luke d'Achery,</hi> a Benedictine Friar. I find in theſe Cuſtoms ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things which make ſome think, that the Opinion of <hi>Paſchas</hi> was not received in this famous Congregation at the beginning of its Inſtitution, nor in all the X. Century. And I take notice par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly of that time, becauſe thoſe perſons would not deny, but
<pb n="446" facs="tcp:47504:226"/>that the Congregation might have changed Opinion after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> not that there is any certain proof there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; but if it be conſidered that it was under the Protection of the <hi>Roman</hi> See, one may be inclined to believe, that as ſoon as that See declared againſt the Doctrine of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> which was that of the enemies of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> this Society of <hi>Cluny</hi> did alſo embrace the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion favoured by its Protectors. But becauſe it cannot be percei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that there was in theſe Ancient Cuſtoms above mentioned, certain paſſages which agreed not well with the Doctrine of the real Preſence, or that having perceived it, they dared not to take them away, it being come to the knowledge of too many People, we therefore find them yet therein at this time; and it is from hence we intend to draw proofs of what hath been ſaid, That this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation was not at firſt, nor in all likelihood during all the X. Century, of the Opinion of <hi>Paſchas;</hi> and as they be the firſt that have produced an inſtance in this matter, they endeavour to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth of it in ſuch a manner, which as they think, will not be diſpleaſing unto all reaſonable perſons, and unto ſuch as as are wont to judge of things according to reaſon and truth; They ſay then in the firſt place, that at the time when theſe Cuſtoms were written, <hi>to wit,</hi> about the end of the XI. Centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, the Bread ſteeped in Wine for Celebrating the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, was practiſed; which ſheweth that in all likelihood, they were not come unto this uſe, until after the Condemnation of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> the fear of ſhedding, not having entred into their thoughts until that time, becauſe they believed not that what was in the Cup was the very ſubſtance of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Unto all thoſe to whom is given the Sacred Body,

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, It was the cuſtom in this Monaſtery, not to keep any part of the Communion until the next day; but they cauſed to be eaten at the ſame time, all that remained; which ſay ſome, would not have been done, if they had believed that it had been the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe they juſt before received it in Communicating; which makes them eaſily believe, that the aboliſhing of this Cuſtom,

                  <pb n="447" facs="tcp:47504:226"/>
                  <p>In the third place, we therein find, that the day before the Preparation, that is to ſay, on Holy Thurſday,
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 58.</note> 
                     <hi>There was ſo much of the Sacrament kept as needed for to Communicate them all;
<note place="margin">Ibid. l. 2. c. 30, p. 140.</note> that it was broken and diſtributed as they could conveniently take it.</hi> And elſewhere, <hi>The Cup is carefully rubbed without, fearing there ſhould remain any part of the Wine and of the Water; and being Conſecrated, that it might be loſt.</hi> They believed then that the Wine and Water did ſtill ſubſiſt after Conſecration;
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 141.</note> for the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt cannot be loſt. And again, <hi>The Prieſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vides the Hoſt, and puts part of it into the Blood; of one half he Communicates himſelf, and with the reſt, he Communicates the Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid. p. 145.</note> Many think it cannot be ſo ſpoken of the glorious Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. And then again, <hi>When the Prieſt hath broken the Hoſt, he puts part of it into the Cup, according to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, and two parts upon the Patten, and he covers both with the Corporal; but firſt of all, he carefully rubs the outſide of the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice, and ſhakes it, with the ſame Fingers wherewith he touched it; fearing leſt that in performing the fraction, there might not remain ſome part of the Body of our Lord;</hi> which cannot be ſpoken of the real Body of the Son of God. And in another place,
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 148.</note> it is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed what ought to be done: <hi>If it ſo happens, that there remains ever ſo little of the Body of Chriſt, which is expounded to be a very little crum; and as it may be ſaid, indiviſible part, like to an Atom.</hi> In fine, treating of the Communicating ſick Folks,
<note place="margin">Ibid. l. 3. c. 28.</note> it is obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>That the Body of our Lord is brought from the Church, that it is broken, and that the Prieſt holds upon the Cup the portion that he ſhould bring.</hi> Now let any body judge, if a part of the real Body of Chriſt can be ſeparated from the whole, and be carried into ſome other place; and that after all that hath been alledged of theſe Ancient Cuſtoms, it ought not to be concluded, that this famous Congregation was not always of the belief it is at this time, in the point of the Sacrament; and that during the X. Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, they embraced not the Opinion of <hi>Paſchas.</hi> This is the Infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which perſons draw from theſe Cuſtoms.</p>
                  <p>But it is not yet time to have done with this Age, we muſt firſt take a view of <hi>Italy,</hi> and of <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, to be informed of <hi>Ratherius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Verona,</hi> who departed this Life in the year 974. what the belief of the Church was in <hi>Italy,</hi> in his time, touching the Euchariſt. I do not intend here to write the Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of this Prelate, nor the Viciſſitudes which happened him du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life; for of a Friar that he was, in the Monaſtery of <hi>Lobes,</hi> he became Biſhop of <hi>Verona;</hi> from whence, ſome time after, he was expell'd, and made Biſhop of <hi>Liege:</hi> but for three years only, and then he loſt this Dignity.

I confeſs, I cannot think nor ſay, what it is, unto him which receiveth unworthily;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>unto him which dwelleth not in God.</hi> By the Doctrine of the real Preſence, what is received at the Holy Table, is the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt, unto the good and to the wicked; there is no examining, if the proper Body of the Son of God be received worthily or unworthily; they only ſay, that if this Doctrine had been in vogue in <hi>Ratherius</hi> his time, he would not have been to ſeek, to know what it was the wicked did receive in the Communion, becauſe he could not but have known, that it is the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, he declares poſitively, that he is throughly perſuaded, that the Corporal ſubſtance which is received in the Sacrament, is unto Believers, the true Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; and truly with great reaſon, becauſe then the Sacrament is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with all the Vertue and Efficacy of this holy Fleſh, and of this precious Blood, which is inſeparable from their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Efficacy. But as to him which Communicates unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, he cannot ſay, nor ſo much as imagine what it is. He knew very well it was the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine, for he
<pb n="449" facs="tcp:47504:227"/>ſaith, <hi>That it is ſeen that the Bread and Wine are the ſame they were before.</hi> But becauſe the Conſecration makes them to be the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; Sacraments which become unto Believers, after the manner as we have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, this Body and this Blood. He cannot conceive what they become unto the wicked; that is to ſay, How one and the ſame Sacrament is unto ſome the Body and Blood of Chriſt; and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others, a bare Sacrament only.</p>
                  <p>Nevertheleſs, had it then been believed in <hi>Italy,</hi> as it is now believed, he could not have doubted, but that it was both unto the one and the others, the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it produced not in all the ſame effect, by reaſon of the variety of diſpoſitions. <hi>Ratherius</hi> was ſettled, as it were, at the Gates of <hi>Rome,</hi> as it may be ſaid. It is not likely then that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> had as yet embraced the Opinion of <hi>Paſchas;</hi> who taught, that the Sacrament was no other Fleſh but that which was born of the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi> for <hi>Ratherius</hi> could not then be ignorant of it; and not being ignorant, he would not have put himſelf the queſtion which he did, and had not yielded in anſwering of it.</p>
                  <p>And as to what is ſaid by the ſame <hi>Ratherius,</hi> in reproving the Exceſs and Debauchery of ſome of his Prieſts,
<note place="margin">Id. Synodica ad Presbyt. p. 259.</note> 
                     <hi>That there are ſome that ſpewed before the Altar of our Lord, upon the Fleſh and Blood it ſelf of the Lamb.</hi> It may eaſily be ſeen that it is an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt expreſſion, to aggravate the ſin of thoſe of whom he ſpeaks; and that the Body of our Lord being ſecured from theſe indignities by the Confeſſion of all Chriſtians, it muſt neceſſarily be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the Sacrament, which takes the name of the thing which it ſignifies, and the violation whereof, reflects upon him which inſtituted it. This is what ſeveral infer from the words of <hi>Ratherius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I will not fear to joyn unto <hi>Ratherius,</hi> another Witneſs, which was alſo a Biſhop in <hi>Italy,</hi> and which is lately given unto the publick: It is <hi>Atto,</hi> the ſecond of that name, Biſhop of <hi>Verceil,

I will not ſtand upon his prohibiting his Prieſts from ſaying private Maſſes, nor in that he commands to handle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently the Bread, the Wine and Water, without which Maſſes cannot be ſaid. I will only obſerve what he requires,
<note place="margin">Ib. c. 86. p. 31.</note> 
                     <hi>That he which honoureth not by Faſting and Abſtinence, the day of the Paſſion of our Lord,</hi> (that is to ſay Good <hi>Friday</hi>) <hi>may be deprived of the Joy of Eaſter; and that he may not receive the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of our Lord.</hi> The occaſion, ſay ſome, required, That he ſhould not have ſaid the Sacrament, but the Body and Blood, if he had believed that the Euchariſt was the real Body
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:47504:228"/>of Jeſus Chriſt; for the puniſhment had been the greater, and by conſequence, the fitter to have retained the others in their Dury. And in one of his Letters unto the Prieſts of his Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, going about to diſſwade them from Fornication, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vite them unto Chaſtity and Continence, he repreſents unto them amongſt other things, what they do in the Celebration of the Euchariſt. There's no body, add they, but may eaſily under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, but that it was the proper place to alledge the priviledge they had of making and giving unto Communicants, the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt; and that there is no Biſhop in the Latin Church, but would have done ſo in ſuch an occaſion: But as for <hi>Atto,</hi> he ſpeaks only of the Sacrament; becauſe in all likelihood, he believed not as the Latins do at this time; for then he would not have failed to have ſpoken as they do;

<note place="margin">Id. Ep. 1. p 437 438.</note> he calls this
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:47504:229"/>Change, a Change of Dignity; that is to ſay, of Quality, which the Ancients often deſign by the name of Subſtance, as hath been ſhewn; he compares the Change which happens in the Euchariſt, unto that which came unto the Manna in the Wilderneſs, and unto that which comes unto Men in Baptiſm; and that he teſtifies, <hi>That there is alſo a Transfuſion of Believers into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> But I judge ſo, becauſe he ſeems to me to have embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Opinion of <hi>Remy</hi> of <hi>Auxerr,</hi> which was the ſame of <hi>John Damaſcen;</hi> who taught not that the ſubſtance of the Symbols was aboliſhed, but that they were united unto the Divinity, to make one Body with the Natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt; as hath been fully ſhewed. And that theſe were the thoughts of <hi>Fulbert,</hi> it appears, if I miſtake not, by what he ſaith, <hi>That the Pledge which our Saviour hath left us, is not the Symbol of an empty Myſtery, but the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Compaginante Spiritu Sancto;
<note place="margin">Id. ibid. p. 437.</note> or, as <hi>Remy</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Conjungente;</hi> that is to ſay, that the Holy Spirit unites, joyns, and knits the Sacrament unto the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt, in uniting it unto the Divinity.

                  <p>About the time that <hi>Fulbert</hi> of <hi>Chartres</hi> flouriſhed, <hi>Bernon,</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of <hi>Augy,</hi> wrote his Treatiſe of things which concerned the Maſs; to wit, about the Year 1030. and <hi>Fulbert</hi> died in 1027.

                     <note place="margin">Cap. 1. &amp; 2. t. 10 Bibl.

<note place="margin">Cap. 1.</note> And he ſhews it plainly, when he ſaid, <hi>That this Body of Jeſus Chriſt is broken.</hi> Which cannot be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of his true Body, which is not ſubject unto this Accident; and that moreover he declares,
<note place="margin">Cap. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>That we are refreſhed with the Wine which is in the Cup, in Type of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

<pb n="453" facs="tcp:47504:229"/>Body and Blood. The truth is, <hi>Bruno,</hi> ſuffering himſelf to be overcome with fear, became ſilent a little after: for, ſay ſome, it often happens upon theſe occaſions, that Men hearken to the Counſels of the Fleſh, rather than unto thoſe of the Spirit. But as for <hi>Berengarius,</hi> he had more ſtrength and courage; and oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf with more Reſolution and Vigour unto the ſetling of the Doctrine which <hi>Paſchas</hi> begun to teach in the IX. Century, but without any great ſucceſs, until the XI. wherein it alſo found a great many Oppoſers.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant that ſome Enemies of <hi>Berengarius</hi> have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ſlander him, to render his Belief the more odious; but the truth is, he was reputed to be a very learned Man, groun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in Philoſophy, and the knowledge of the Liberal Arts; and moreover, of a holy and unblameable Life. A fragment of the Hiſtory of <hi>France,</hi> from the time of King <hi>Robert,</hi>

<note place="margin">Tom. 2. Spicil. p. 747.</note> 
                     <hi>That he was very learned.</hi> And the Friar <hi>Clarius,</hi> in his Chronicle of St. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Sans,</hi> gives him theſe two Epithets, of <hi>Admirable Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher,</hi> and <hi>Lover of the Poor.</hi> But in fine, the Belief which he maintained upon the Subject of the Euchariſt, and which was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary unto that of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> found the people ſo diſpoſed to entertain it, or rather, to declare openly for it, ſo that in all parts it was publickly profeſſed. And this eaſily perſuades me, that <hi>Berengarius</hi> did not ſo much infuſe this Opinion into them, as he encouraged them by his Example to publiſh it, by rouſing them up from the ſtupidneſs wherein they had layen for ſome time. For had this people believed no more of the Euchariſt than juſt what <hi>Berengarius</hi> had taught, this Doctrine could ſcarce have made ſo great a progreſs in ſo little a time: but as it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtill'd into them from Father to Son, <hi>Berengarius</hi> had no ſooner opened his mouth, but that they embraced it, not regarding the fear that had till then diſcouraged them, ſeeing the Contradiction it found in the World, whilſt that of <hi>Paſchas</hi> therein received fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour and encouragement. But becauſe the Enemies of this Doctrine have looked upon <hi>Berengarius</hi> to have been the true Author of it, they have taxed him of infecting with the Venom of his Hereſie all thoſe which, by his example, had the courage to make Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion

                     <hi>That all</hi> France <hi>was full of his Doctrine.</hi> So it is that <hi>Durandus</hi> of <hi>Troarn,</hi> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Monaſtery in <hi>Normandy,</hi> alſo ſaith in a Treatiſe which he made of the Body and Blood of Chriſt, wherein he oppoſeth the Doctrine taught by <hi>Berengarius: It cannot be doubted but that the Doctrine of</hi> Berengarius <hi>was the ſame with that taught by ſeveral in the IX. Century, which oppoſed the Opinions of</hi> Paſchas, <hi>as Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which until then had not been heard of in the Church.</hi> If then the Doctrine of the Adverſaries of <hi>Paſchas</hi> was the ancient Belief of Chriſtians, as we ſuppoſe hath been ſufficiently proved, it muſt be granted, that <hi>Berengarius</hi> did not depart from it; and that thoſe which followed him had been of old inſtructed therein: Therefore, as ſoon as he began to bubliſh it, they knew it; and without any difficulty, made Profeſſion of it. But if <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius</hi> had Friends, he alſo had Enemies; if he had Followers, he had alſo thoſe which oppoſed him.

                     <hi>That the Euchariſt is not the true Body, nor the real Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; but the Figure and Reſemblance.

<pb n="455" facs="tcp:47504:230"/>againſt perſons which taught, that the Sacrament is not the Body of Chriſt, but the Figure of his Body; which this Prelate calls, Renewing of ancient Hereſies. And to ſhew with what Spirit this Biſhop was acted, he exhorts the King to deliberate of their puniſhment, rather than to hear them in Councils. Moreover, I have called this Biſhop of <hi>Liege, Durandus,</hi> after <hi>Baronius,</hi> and thoſe which have given us the Library of the holy Fathers; but according to the truth of the Hiſtory it cannot be ſo, becauſe <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randus</hi> was dead before <hi>Bruno</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Angers.</hi> And indeed, <hi>Durandus</hi> died, <hi>Anno</hi> 1025. according to <hi>Segebert,</hi> and <hi>Bruno</hi> attained not unto the Epiſcopacy until 1047. Of neceſſity then, this Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Liege</hi> muſt be ſome other than <hi>Durandus;</hi> and probably it may be <hi>Dietuvin,</hi> who was made Biſhop of <hi>Liege</hi> in the Year 1048. about which time, he and <hi>Adelman</hi> might have writ the Letters above mentioned.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Durandus,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Troam</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> makes ſome men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, at the end of his Treatiſe of the Body and Blood of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, of a Council aſſembled at <hi>Paris,</hi> by the Authority of the King, againſt <hi>Berengarius</hi> and his Followers, where the Doctrine of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> abſent and unheard, was condemned: and it was there concluded, that he, and thoſe of his Judgment ſhould be proſecuted in all parts, and that they ſhould be beſieged where they ſhould be found aſſembled, to force them to renounce their Belief, or be taken and put to death; a Remedy very contrary unto the temper of the Goſpel, and unto the mildneſs of the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt. But after all, this Council of <hi>Paris</hi> is no other than a fiction of the Author's brain. For what likeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is there that <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> who wrote againſt <hi>Berengarius</hi> after this pretended Council, would have paſſed it over in ſilence, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſo exactly mentioned all the Councils which were aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled againſt <hi>Berengarius;</hi> in ſome of which he was preſent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Moreover,
<note place="margin">Anonymus de damnatione Berengarii multiplici.</note> Father <hi>Chifflet</hi> hath printed an Anonymous Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, which ſpecifies all the Synods wherein the Belief of <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius</hi> was condemned; at the laſt of which himſelf was preſent at <hi>Rome, Anno</hi> 1079. under <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, without ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king any mention of that of <hi>Paris.</hi> Whereunto may be added, that the Date, and Character of the time doth not agree with the truth of Hiſtory.

                  <p>We are informed by <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> that in the Year 1050. Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Ninth aſſembled two Councils; one at <hi>Rome,</hi> where

                  <p>The Anonymous alſo failed not to begin the Hiſtory of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Condemnations of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> by theſe two Councils of <hi>Rome</hi> and of <hi>Verceil.</hi> But theſe two Councils hindred not but that many wrote for him, as there were many that wrote againſt him; ſo it is expreſſed in <hi>Sigebert</hi>'s Chronicle,

                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, there is in Monſieur <hi>de Thou</hi>'s Library, a Manuſcript Copy of the Chronicle of <hi>Sigebert,</hi> wherein this is read; France <hi>is troubled by reaſon of</hi> Berengarius <hi>of</hi> Towers; <hi>who affirmed that the Sacrament which we receive at the Altar is not really the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, but the Figure of his Body and Blood: for which cauſe, ſeveral diſputed with much heat for and againſt him, by Word of mouth, and by Writing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Berengarius</hi> himſelf, he ſo little valued the <hi>Anathema's</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Verceil,</hi> that he ſpake very ſlightly of Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the Ninth, and of his See; as it was ſeen formerly in <hi>Guitmond,</hi> his Adverſary, before it was altered by the Expurgatory Indexes: but that's in vain,
<note place="margin">Anonym. p. 363.</note> ſeeing Father <hi>Chifflet</hi>'s Anonymous relates al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt the ſame thing, and near hand in the very ſame terms, which I will ſave my ſelf the trouble of tranſcribing, becauſe they be ſomething ſharp, and full of Contempt. <hi>Victor,</hi> Succeſſor unto <hi>Leo,</hi> ſeeing that <hi>Berengarius</hi> ſtill perſiſted in his Opinion, and that he ceaſed not to publiſh it, notwithſtanding the thundring of <hi>Leo</hi>'s two Councils, cauſed one to be aſſembled at <hi>Towers, Anno</hi> 1055. wherein his Sub-Deacon <hi>Hildebrand,</hi> who was afterwards Pope, under the name of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, preſided; and the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſaries of <hi>Berengarius; Lanfranc, Guitmond,</hi> and the Anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, before mentioned, have writ, that <hi>Berengarius</hi> there pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented himſelf, and dared not to defend his Cauſe; chuſing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to ſubmit unto what <hi>Rome</hi> had determined in the matter. We not having the Acts of this Synod, it would be difficult to ſpeak certainly of it, it not being juſt, wholly to give Credit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to what his Adverſaries relate of him, which doth not appear to agree with the following part of the Hiſtory: For <hi>Nicholas,</hi> the
<pb n="457" facs="tcp:47504:231"/>Second of that Name, was obliged to aſſemble another Council at <hi>Rome,</hi> five years after that of <hi>Tours: Berengarius</hi> there appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and if we will believe <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> and <hi>Chifflet</hi>'s Anonymous, he dared not to defend his Belief.
<note place="margin">Chron. Caſſin. l. 3. c. 33. Sigon. de Regn.

<note place="margin">Tom. 6. Bibl. Pat. p. 189.</note> confeſſed the Orthodox Faith; not for love of the Truth, but through fear of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Chifflet</hi>'s Anonymous doth obſerve a conſiderable Circumſtance, and which, as I think, deſerves to find place in this Hiſtory of <hi>Berengarius:</hi> for he ſaid,
<note place="margin">Anonym. ubi ſupra.</note> that <hi>Alexander</hi> the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, which ſucceeded <hi>Nicholas, Anno</hi> 1061. did in a very friendly manner, by his Letters, adviſe and deſire <hi>Berengarius</hi> to lay aſide his Opinion, and not to ſcandalize the Church: But that <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius</hi> would by no means depart from his Judgment, and that he had the courage to declare ſo much unto the Pope by Letters. Thence it was that <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, Succeſſor unto <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> gave him Audience in two Councils; as the Anonymous ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, who aſſiſted at the latter, aſſembled at <hi>Rome, Anno</hi> 1079. As for the former, held at the ſame place, he mentions not at what time; but ſo it is, that in the latter Council, there was drawn up another Confeſſion of Faith, much milder and more moderate than that which had been made in <hi>Nicholas</hi> his time; and they obliged <hi>Berengarius</hi> to ſign it.

                  <p>And it muſt be remembred, that this Synod of <hi>Gregory</hi>'s was full of Conteſts upon this Subject of the Sacrament; there being yet a great many Prelates which defended the Opinions of <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius,</hi> againſt the Reality of <hi>Paſchas;</hi> as appears by the Acts of this Council, related by <hi>Thomas Waldenſis,</hi> and <hi>Hugh de Flavig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi>

But in fine, The Acts produced by <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> and what the Chronicle of <hi>Verdon</hi> alledges, doth teſtifie that there were thoſe in this Aſſembly which affirmed that the Euchariſt is the Figure of the Body of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But that nothing may be wanting unto the Hiſtory of <hi>Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius,</hi> it is neceſſary to touch upon ſome Circumſtances which have not yet been mentioned. In the firſt place, His Adverſaries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing enraged againſt him, have not feared to charge him with ſome Errors touching Marriage, and Infant-Baptiſm; as if he taught the Diſſolution of lawful Marriage, and rejected the Baptizing of young Children; but without any other Ground than meer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; which, as the Poet ſaid, is an Evil that flies, and increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in its Progreſs.

                  <p>In the ſecond place, <hi>Berengarius</hi> had to deal with Adverſaries which made no Conſcience of corrupting Tradition, and the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and to deny the moſt evident things. <hi>Lanfranc</hi> very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidently tells us, that there were formerly two Hereſies which proceeded from theſe words of Jeſus Chriſt;

                     <hi>If you eat not the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, you have no Life in you. They all believed</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with one common conſent, that the Bread and Wine was changed into the real Fleſh and Blood of the Son of Man; but they were not agreed who this Son of Man was. Some thought that it might be meant of any Man whatever, whether juſt or ſinful; and that the earthly ſubſtance, changed into his Fleſh and Blood, was received in the Remiſſion of Sins. Others conceived that this Son of Man was not any Man of the ordinary ſort, but a holy, juſt perſon, ſeparated by his excellent living, from the common ſort of men, which was the Temple of God, in whom the Divinity reſided: and they confidently and heretically maintained, that the Bread and Wine of the Altar might be changed into his Fleſh and Blood. But</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the time of Pope</hi> Celeſtin, <hi>and of</hi> Cyril <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria, <hi>the Council of</hi> Epheſus <hi>was celebrated; where theſe two mortal
<pb n="459" facs="tcp:47504:232"/>Hereſies were condemned, and the Faith was confirmed, whereby we believe, that the Bread is changed into the Fleſh that was crucified, and the Wine into the Blood which flowed out of the ſide of Jeſus Chriſt hanging on the Croſs.</hi> To ſee the confidence wherewith this Prelate entertains his Readers with theſe two Hereſies, and their Condemnation at the Council of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> one would take his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation for a true Hiſtory; and yet it is but a meer forged Fable: and the people of the XI Century did receive it upon Credit, to be as true as Goſpel. It is the ſame <hi>Lanfranc</hi> that relates unto us as a true paſſage of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s, theſe words which had been before falſly alledged by <hi>Paſchas; Receive in the Bread what was nailed to the Croſs; and in the Cup, what iſſued out of the ſide of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>

It is granted that <hi>Berengarius</hi> began to publiſh his Opinions about the Year 1035. at which time he muſt be about thirty years old; for it is not likely that he made any great ſtir before that Age. He defended his Cauſe at <hi>Rome</hi> in the Year 1079. that is, according to our Computation, in his 74th Year: which is directly contrary unto what <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> ſaith; <hi>That after the firſt fire of his Youth, he repented in a riper Age.</hi> More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, it appears by a Letter from <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> unto <hi>Reginald,</hi> Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot of St. <hi>Cyprian</hi> of <hi>Poitiers,</hi> writ very probably in 1087. or

<note place="margin">Tom. 2. Eibl. l'Abbe p. 212.</note> 
                     <hi>There was a Council aſſembled at</hi> Bourdeaux, <hi>wherein</hi> Berengarius <hi>gave an account of his Faith.</hi> According unto this Chronicle (for which we are obliged unto the Induſtry of Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>l'Abbe</hi>) <hi>Berengarius</hi> did yet defend his Belief and Doctrine a Year after the Council held at <hi>Rome,</hi> under <hi>Gregory</hi> the Seventh, <hi>An.</hi> 1079. Unto all theſe Conſiderations may be added an Anony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Author, who wrote, <hi>Anno</hi> 1088. which was the year of the death of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> a ſmall Treatiſe, whoſe Title was, <hi>De</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarii <hi>Haereſiarche Damnatione multiplici, Of the ſeveral Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of</hi> Berengarius <hi>the Heretick:</hi> which ſheweth, if I miſtake not, that he retained his Opinion unto his death. And Father <hi>Chifflet,</hi> who gave us this Anonymous; doth ſufficiently ſhew that he believes ſo, when he ſaith in the Preface, being offended with the Commendations given unto <hi>Berengarius,</hi> by <hi>Hildebert,</hi> that this Anymous made his Obſequies after a more diſcreet manner,

                     <hi>Prudentius ei funus duxit;</hi> to wit, in calling him Heretick unto his death. I would then conclude, after all that hath been ſaid, that <hi>William</hi> of <hi>Malmesbury</hi> was deceived in placing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of <hi>Berengarius</hi> after the firſt vigour of his Youth,
<note place="margin">Guill. Malmsb. luſt. l. 3. c. 27.</note> in a riper Age; and that the Hiſtory of this Converſion is no more true, than what he related unto us of <hi>Fulbert,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chartres;</hi> that as he was at the point of death, his Houſe was throng'd with people that flocked thither from all parts; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving <hi>Berengarius</hi> amongſt the Croud, he made a ſign that he ſhould be driven away; proteſting that there was by him a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Devil, and that he infected a great many by his tongue, and by his hand: for none of <hi>Berengarius</hi> his Adverſaries who had ſtudied under <hi>Fulbert</hi> never taxed him with any ſuch thing; not ſo much as <hi>Adelman,</hi> his Fellow-ſtudent under this famous Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late.
<note place="margin">Tom. 2.

                  <p>But having examined what paſſed in the Weſt during the XI. Century, touching the Subject of the Sacrament, we muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to find what was believed concerning it in the Greek Church, we will begin this Enquiry by <hi>Theophilact,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Bulgaria,</hi> who lived in this Century under the Dukes, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Commenes, Emperors of the Eaſt: the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks and Proteſtants do both make pretenſions unto him, and think that he favours either of them.

                     <hi>Mark,</hi> where he ſaith almoſt the ſame thing; obſerving, <hi>That the Bread is changed into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; and that our Lord ſaid not of the Bread,</hi> This is the Figure of my Body, <hi>but my Body.</hi>

                     <hi>Mark; That the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is properly what is in the Golden Patten; and the Blood, that which is in the Cup.</hi> But the others, that is to ſay, the Proteſtants, alledge, that <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lact</hi> hath explained himſelf very well in making this poſitive De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration;
<note place="margin">Id. in Mar. c. 14</note> 
                     <hi>God condeſcending unto our infirmities, preſerves the Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of Bread and Wine, and doth change them into the vertue of his Body and Blood.</hi> Which is exactly the Doctrine of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> who ſaid,
<note place="margin">1 Apud Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem in Marc. 14. manuſ.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Bread and Wine are changed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the efficacy of his Fleſh:</hi> or, as <hi>Theodotus</hi> ſaid before him,
<note place="margin">2 Apud Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Alexan. p. 800.</note> 
                     <hi>Into a ſpiritual Vertue.</hi> So that when <hi>Theophilact</hi> ſaid, <hi>That the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not the Antitype of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, but his true Body, and his Fleſh it ſelf,</hi> they ſay, that he underſtood that it was not a vain and empty Figure, without any efficacy and vertue; but not that he had any thoughts of abſolutely denying that the Euchariſt was an Antitype and Figure of the Body and Blood of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, becauſe then he ſhould deny what his Predeceſſors had una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimouſly affirmed: and that ſo indeed, the Sacrament is truly the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, according to <hi>Theophilact;</hi> not in ſubſtance, but in vertue and efficacy; becauſe he declares, that the Bread and Wine are changed into the vertue of the Fleſh and Blood of our Lord; and that although our Lord ſaid not of the Bread, <hi>This is the Figure of my Body,</hi> but <hi>my Body;</hi> nevertheleſs, his meaning was, that his words ſhould ſo be underſtood, according to the Explication of <hi>Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin, Facundus,</hi> and others; who declare formally, that theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> do ſignifie, This is the Figure, the Sign, and the Sacrament of my Body. But that the Reader may the better judge of what ſide to range <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>philact,</hi> either on the Proteſtants, or the Roman Catholicks, it will be neceſſary to conſider what the Belief of the Greek Church was, touching the Sacrament, in the XI. Century: for if the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Greeks was not conformable with that of the Latins in that Age, <hi>Theophilact</hi> cannot reaſonably be interpreted to favour the Real Preſence, unleſs that he differed abſolutely from the Opinion generally received by all thoſe of his Country; in which ſenſe, his Teſtimony would not be very conſiderable. Now I obſerve, that at that time the Greeks believed, for certain, that the Communion broke the Faſt; and that what is received in the Euchariſt, goes down into the Belly, and paſſeth into the Draft,
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:47504:234"/>as to its matter; which ſheweth plainly, that they believed it was true Bread. It is what Cardinal <hi>Humbert,</hi> who was ſent unto them by Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the IX. chargeth upon <hi>Nicetas Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratus,

                     <note place="margin">Allatius de Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meonibus p. 163.</note> ſpeaks of a certain Hymn, the title whereof was, <hi>That whoſoever liveth without the knowledge of God, is dead in the midſt of thoſe which live in the knowledge of him; and that thoſe which participate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily of the Myſteries, cannot receive the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It were to be wiſhed that <hi>Allatius</hi> had given us the whole Hymn, as well as the Argument; but however, this Argument contains a Doctrine manifeſtly contrary unto that of the Latins; in favour of whom, by conſequence, it is very un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like that <hi>Theophylact</hi> ſhould declare, ſeeing he was of the Greek Church, and lived in the XI. Century, at which time the Greeks believed and taught what is above written; yet let every body judge ſincerely and freely, without any other intereſt than that of truth, which I endeavour to repreſent in this Hiſtory, which informs us, that it was in this Age, that they begun to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the Communion under one kind; and to change the form of the Bread of the Euchariſt in the Churches of the Weſt, as hath been diſcourſed at large in the Firſt Part.</p>

                  <argument>
                     <p>A Continuation of the Hiſtory of the Euchariſt, or the State of the XII. and XIII. Centuries.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>THe Opinion of <hi>Paſchas</hi> having been in fine, publickly Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed in the XI. Century, there needs no farther enquiry be made, to know if it obtain'd the Victory over its Adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the thing being without any difficulty; the eſtabliſhing of this Doctrine being a manifeſt condemnation of that which was oppoſite unto it; it will ſuffice then to underſtand what were the conſequences, and to what effect ſo many Decrees, in favour of the Opinion of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> and contrary unto that of which <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius</hi> and his followers, ſo ſtoutly maintained, did work upon the minds of men; for during all the XI. Century, the minds of Men were divided; and notwithſtanding the deciſions of ſeveral Councils, there was in all parts, infinite numbers of People, which made open profeſſion of the Doctrine which <hi>Berengarius</hi> taught, and which was exactly that of the Adverſaries of <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas;</hi> therefore the very Enemies of <hi>Berengarius</hi> told us in the foregoing Chapter, <hi>That all</hi> France, Italy, <hi>and</hi> England, <hi>was full of his Doctrine.</hi> In fine, the party which rejected the Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of <hi>Gregory</hi> the VII. againſt <hi>Berengarius,</hi> was ſo conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable, that <hi>Urban</hi> the Second was conſtrained to condemn anew, the Opinion of <hi>Berengarius</hi> in another Council held at <hi>Plaiſance, Anno</hi> 1095.
<note place="margin">Berthold. ad aunum 1095.</note> as <hi>Bertholdus</hi> has obſerved in his Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix unto <hi>Herman Contract;</hi> for relating all things that were tranſlated in this Council of <hi>Plaiſance,</hi> which was celebrated in his time, he ſaith amongſt other things, that the Doctrine of <hi>Berengarius</hi> was there again condemned, after having been ſo ſeveral times before. But as the former Determinations could not impoſe ſilence upon the Diſciples of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> I mean thoſe which embraced the ſame Doctrine, which obliged <hi>Urban</hi> to condemn them again in the year 1095. ſeven years after the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſe of <hi>Berengarius;</hi> ſo alſo the condemnation of <hi>Urban</hi> the Second had not power ſufficient to ſilence them, ſeeing that in the beginning of the XII. Century, <hi>Bruno</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Treves,</hi> expell'd great numbers of them out of his Dioceſs, as is teſtified by <hi>Monſieur de Thou,</hi> in the Epiſtle Dedicatory of his Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that inſtead of the year 1060. whereto he aſſigns the action of this Prelate, it ſhould be read 1106. becauſe <hi>Bruno</hi> was not made Archbiſhop of <hi>Treves,</hi> till after the year 1100.
<pb n="466" facs="tcp:47504:236"/>Biſhop <hi>Uſher</hi> makes mention of the Author of the Acts of <hi>Bruno,</hi> who was preſent, and is a Manuſcript to be ſeen in <hi>England;</hi> and he ſaith, that this Author ſpeaks of Aſſemblies which were made in the Dioceſs of <hi>Treves,</hi> by thoſe which denied the change of the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine, into the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Waldenſ. t. 2. c. 90.</note> It is about this time that <hi>Honorius,</hi> Prieſt and Theologal of the Church of <hi>Autun,</hi> is ſaid to flouriſh, which <hi>Thomas Waldenſis</hi> alledges againſt <hi>Wickliff,</hi> as a Diſciple and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lower of the Hereſie of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> which he himſelf confeſſeth to agree with the Doctrine of <hi>Rabanus</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Mayance,</hi> and great Adverſary unto <hi>Paſchas;</hi> when he ſaith, that <hi>Honorius,</hi> eſt de ſecta panitarum Rabani, <hi>that is to ſay, of the Sect of thoſe which believe with</hi> Rabanus, <hi>That the Euchariſt is bread in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, fit to nouriſh the body, but the body of Jeſus Chriſt in efficacy.</hi> It is true, <hi>Waldenſis</hi> doth not particularly name <hi>Honorius;</hi> but he means him ſo clearly by the entrance of his Treatiſe, and by the paſſages he alledgeth, and which is therein now to be ſeen, that no body can doubt but that 'twas of <hi>Honorius</hi> he ſpake. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do I find, that any are at variance hereupon. The firſt teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony produced by <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> and which <hi>Wickliff</hi> alledged for the defence of his Opinion,

The ſecond mentioned by <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> is borrowed of <hi>Rabanus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Id. l. 1. c. 111.</note> and is thus read: <hi>The Sacrament which is received by the mouth, is turned into the nouriſhment of the body; but the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Sacrament is that whereby the inward Man is ſatisfied; and by this vertue is acquired Eternal Life.</hi> The ſame Author ſaith again,
<note place="margin">Id. ib. c. 63.</note> that the Hoſt is broken, <hi>Becauſe the bread of Angels was broken for us upon the Croſs, that the Biſhop bites part of it, that he divides it into three parts;
<note place="margin">Id. c. 64.</note> that it is not received whole, but broke into three bits;
<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 85.</note> and that when the Bread is put into the Wine, it is repreſented, that the Soul of our Lord returned into his body:</hi> And he calls it,
<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 63.</note> to break the Body of our Lord, when he obſerves, <hi>That the Sub-Deacon receives from the Deacon, the body of our Lord; and that he carries it to the Prieſts to break it unto the People.</hi> All Men do confeſs, that the glorified Body of Jeſus Chriſt cannot be broken and divided into parts; of neceſſity he muſt then ſpeak of the Sacrament, which is called the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, not by reaſon of the accidents, which is never qualified with this name by the Ancients, but in regard of its ſubſtance; therefore <hi>Honorius</hi> declareth plainly, that it is Bread, when he ſaith, <hi>That
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:47504:236"/>the Conſecrated bread is diſtributed unto the People; and that the bread is put into the Wine.</hi> And ſo far he favours the cauſe of the Proteſtants, in following the Judgment of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> and of <hi>Rabanus,</hi> as is teſtified by <hi>Thomas Waldenſis,</hi> an Enemy both of the one and the other, and by conſequence of <hi>Honorius.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, there be other places in the Treatiſe of this Author, from whence the Roman Catholicks ſtrive to draw advantage; for example, from theſe words, <hi>The name of Myſtery is uſed,
<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 106.</note> when one thing is ſeen, and another thing is underſtood; the Species of Bread and Wine is ſeen, but it is believed to be the body and blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is true, that all Chriſtians confeſs, that the Bread and Wine of the Sacrament after Conſecration, are the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; and the Author not ſpecifying, if it be in ſubſtance, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> doth teach, or in vertue, as the Proteſtants which are called Calviniſts, do ſay; I do not think that either the one or the other, can draw any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage from theſe words. But beſides theſe, there be yet others which ſeem to be more favourable unto the Hypotheſis of the Latins; we may put in this order, what he ſaith,
<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 34.</note> 
                     <hi>That the bread is changed into Fleſh, and that the Wine turns into blood;</hi> and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, <hi>That as the World was made of nothing by the word of God,
<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 105.</note> ſo, by the words of our Lord, the Species of theſe things</hi> (he means the Bread and Wine of the Sacrament) <hi>is truly changed into the body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It muſt be confeſſed, that had we only theſe two laſt paſſages of <hi>Honorius,</hi> the Latin Church would undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly have cauſe to boaſt over thoſe which reject her belief; but that which hinders that ſhe cannot draw all the advantage from it ſhe deſires, is, that the Proteſtants rely in the firſt place, upon the declaration of <hi>Thomas Waldenſis,</hi> who highly condemning the Opinion of <hi>Rabanus,</hi> and of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> as contrary unto the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Latins, doth nevertheleſs ingenuouſly confeſs, that <hi>Honorius</hi> of <hi>Autun,</hi> followed the Opinion of theſe two men, whoſe Doctrine he condemns. In the ſecond place, inaſmuch as the firſt teſtimonies inſtanced in, could receive no favourable interpretation for the Hypotheſis of Roman Catholicks, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the later, whereof they pretend to take hold, may conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently be explained in a way which might no way prejudice the Doctrine of thoſe called Calviniſts; who ſay, that the converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the change ſpoken of by <hi>Honorius,</hi> is not a change of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, but a change of efficacy and vertue, inaſmuch as the Bread and Wine do become by Sanctification, the Sacraments of the Body and Blood of our Lord: but Sacraments, in their lawful Celebration, accompanied with all the vertue, and with all the efficacy of the Body and Blood; ſo that for that reaſon it
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:47504:237"/>is ſaid, that they be changed into this efficacy, and into this ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue; according to the language of <hi>Theodotus,</hi> of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dria,</hi> of <hi>Theophilact, &amp;c.</hi> alledging, to confirm their Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 106.</note> what is ſaid by the ſame <hi>Honorius; That Jeſus Chriſt changed the Bread and Wine into the Sacrament of his Body and Blood;</hi> which St. <hi>Iſidore</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Sevil,</hi> venerable <hi>Bede,</hi> and <hi>Rabanus</hi> Arch-biſhop of <hi>Mayans,</hi> had ſaid before him; as hath been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in ſome part of this Hiſtory. And that in ſpeaking of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the Hoſt into three parts,
<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 64.</note> he declares, <hi>That that which is put into the Cup is the glorified Body of our Lord, and that which the Prieſt eats is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that is to ſay, the Church, which yet is militant here on Earth. Whence they conclude, that ſeeing the Bread of the Sacrament is not, by <hi>Honorius</hi> his ſaying, the natural Body of Jeſus Chriſt: but as it is his myſtical Body; that is to ſay, the Church; for he makes no difference betwixt them, it cannot be it properly, and by an Idendity of ſubſtance, as it is ſpoken; but only in Myſtery, and in Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>If there were only occaſion to ſhew who they were that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted not of the Doctrine of the Real Preſence, we might here inſtance in <hi>Robert de Duitz,</hi> nere <hi>Cologne;</hi> becauſe it is certain, by the confeſſion of both ſides, that he believed it not: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we alſo ſearch the Teſtimonies of thoſe which followed the Opinion of the Adverſaries of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> which was that of <hi>Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius;</hi> of which number we cannot affirm that <hi>Robert</hi> was, we will leave him as a man that was neither a follower of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> nor of his Adverſaries; but a Diſciple of <hi>John Damaſcen,</hi> and of <hi>Remy</hi> of <hi>Auxerr;</hi> teaching, as they did, the Aſſumption of the Bread by the Divinity, to make by this Union with the Divinity, one ſole Body with the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>It is not the ſame with a certain Abbot, called <hi>Francus;</hi> of whom the Centuriators of <hi>Magdebourg</hi> obſerve,
<note place="margin">Centur. 12. c. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>That he had no ſound thoughts touching the Communion; affirming, that the real Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt was not in the Sacrament.</hi> One would fain know who this Abbot was, of whom the Centuriators ſay nothing elſe; and to ſay truth, it is very hard, preciſely to determine it: but becauſe poſitive Proofs are wanting, Conjectures that have like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lihood and probability may the better be admitted; therefore I will not fear ſpeaking what I think of him. I conceive then, that it was <hi>Franco,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Lobbes,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Liege.</hi> There were two of this name in that Monaſtery, one of which lived in the time of <hi>Lewis,</hi> the Son of <hi>Charles</hi> the Bald; and he was rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned the twelfth Abbot: but it cannot be him we ſeek for, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Centuriators place him towards the middle of the XII.
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:47504:237"/>Century; therefore we muſt rather inſiſt upon the other, who ſucceeded unto <hi>Lambert,</hi> about the Year 1153. which is juſt the time deſigned by the Centuriators; for <hi>Lambert</hi> ſucceeded unto <hi>Leonius, Anno</hi> 1140. and governed the Monaſtery thirteen years;
<note place="margin">De geſtis Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batum Lob. t. 6. Spicil. p. 621 622, 628, 629, 630, 631 &amp; 633.</note> ſo that our <hi>Franco,</hi> or <hi>Francus,</hi> was choſen in his place, <hi>Anno</hi> 1153. or 1154. he was Head of the Monaſtery eleven years. And I the rather am induced to believe, that the Centuriators ſpeak of this <hi>Franco,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Lobbes,</hi> becauſe that he ſpake nothing of the Sacrament, but what two of his Predeceſſors, <hi>Folcuin</hi> and <hi>Her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiger,</hi> had taught before, in the X. Century; as we have decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in writing what paſſed in that Age upon the Subject of the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>In the time that <hi>Franco</hi> was Abbot of <hi>Lobbes, Gautier</hi> of <hi>Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritania</hi> was Prebend of <hi>Anthona;</hi> and he was choſen to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> to defend the Cauſe of the Prebends of <hi>Anthona,</hi> againſt the Abbot <hi>Franco,</hi> for a Prebendary which the Friars of <hi>Lobbes</hi> laid claim unto, as having been, time out of mind, in the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal of their Abbots. But ſo it is, that this <hi>Gautier</hi> is ſtyled in the Continuation of the Hiſtory of the Abbots of <hi>Lobbes,
<note place="margin">Ubi ſupra p. 631.</note> The moſt eminent, and chiefeſt of all the Doctors of</hi> France. Alſo, from Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bend of <hi>Anthona,</hi> he became Biſhop of <hi>Laon.</hi> But that matters not: See here how he ſpeaks of the Preſence of Jeſus Chriſt, whilſt he was Biſhop, in a Letter which he wrote, touching the Myſtery of the Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt; and wherein, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding theſe words of the 3d. of St. <hi>John;
<note place="margin">Galterus Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copus Laudun Ep. 2. t. 2. Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. p. 464.</note> No man aſcended up into Heaven, but the Son of Man which came down from Heaven;</hi> he ſpeaks after this manner; <hi>By the Son of Man we are here to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the Word made Fleſh; that is to ſay, the Son of God, which was omnipreſent; and not the Body and Soul, that is to ſay, the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature which he had taken, and which was not yet aſcended into Heaven: for the Fleſh which he had aſſumed, was not preſent in all places; but in ſhifting place, it went fom one place unto another; which our Saviour ſheweth in ſaying unto his Apoſtles,</hi> I am glad, for your ſakes, that I was not there. <hi>The Angel declares the ſame unto the Women; ſaying,</hi> You ſeek Jeſus, who was crucified: he is riſen, he is not here. <hi>From thence it is</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that</hi> St. Gregory <hi>ſaith, He is not here by the preſence of his Body, which nevertheleſs, was never abſent, in regard of the preſence of his Majeſty.</hi> And elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where;
<note place="margin">Id. ibid. Ep. 2. p. 468.</note> 
                     <hi>The Son of God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is on Earth by the preſence of his Divinity, although he is in Heaven, at the Right Hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by the preſence of his Body, and of his Divinity; which he himſelf declared, being ready to aſcend up into Heaven, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Diſciples; ſaying,</hi> I am with you unto the end of the World. <hi>Which words</hi> St. Gregory <hi>thus expounds; The Word made
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:47504:238"/>Fleſh remains, and he departs: he goes in regard of his Body, but he remains in regard of his Divinity.</hi> And in all the reſt of the Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, he proves by Authority of the Scriptures, and of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the Omnipreſence of the Divinity of Jeſus Chriſt, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition unto his Humanity, which he hath ſo repreſented unto us to be in one place, that it could not be at the ſame time in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
                  <p>We may add unto theſe Witneſſes, that which Father <hi>Chifflet</hi> gives us in the Preface which he hath made unto the Confeſſion of Faith which he attributes unto <hi>Alcuin,</hi> Tutor unto <hi>Charlemain;</hi> where, diſputing againſt the Diſciples of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> followers of <hi>Janſenius,</hi> he ſaith, that he might apply unto them what <hi>Hugh Metellus,</hi> Prebend of <hi>Thoul,</hi> had ſaid above five hundred years ago, unto <hi>Gerland,</hi> Sacramentarian of the Sect of <hi>Berengarius: You relie upon the words of</hi> St. Auſtin,
<note place="margin">Chiffict Jeſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta in praefar. ad confeſſ. Alcuin.</note> 
                     <hi>do not put your dependance upon them, he is not of the ſame Opinion you are of, you are much miſtaken: You aſſure us, with</hi> St. Auſtin, <hi>that the words of Jeſus Chriſt unto his Diſciples are figurative, for they declare one thing literally, and they ſignifie another thing: you affirm what he affirmed, but you do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what he believed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may then be concluded from what hath been ſaid; and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, from the words of this Prebend of <hi>Thoul,</hi> that at the beginning of the XII. Century, thoſe which were called <hi>Berenga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians</hi> maintained a Doctrine contrary unto that which was eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by the Deciſions of Councils, which ſeveral Popes cauſed to be aſſembled againſt <hi>Berengarius</hi> in the XI. Century.</p>
                  <p>But all theſe Teſtimonies are nothing in compariſon of what happened in the perſons of thoſe called <hi>Albigenſis;</hi> who refuſing to ſubmit and acquieſs unto the Deciſſion of Popes and their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, in favour of the Doctrine of <hi>Paſchas,</hi> ſeparated themſelves openly from their Communion; and gave their Reaſons for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Book which they publiſhed to that purpoſe in the vulgar Tongue, wherein they made this Declaration of their Faith touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Euchariſt;
<note place="margin">Hiſt. de Albi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genſis de Paul Perrin. l. 3. c. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>The eating of the Sacramental Bread is the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt figuratively; Jeſus Chriſt having ſaid,</hi> As often as you do this, do it in remembrance of me. This Book, as is obſerved by him that inſerted it wholly in his Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the <hi>Albigenſis,</hi> and the <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> was taken from a Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript, wherein was contained ſeveral Sermons of the <hi>Barbes;</hi> ſo it was that thoſe people called their Paſtors: it is dated in the Year 1120. which I find nothing ſtrange, when I conſider that in the Year 1119. Pope <hi>Calixtus</hi> the Second aſſembled a Council at <hi>Tholouſe</hi> in his own preſence, wherein certain Hereticks were condemned, who rejected the Sacrament of the Euchariſt; that
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:47504:238"/>is to ſay, which in all likelihood did not believe what the Latin Church believed. We are obliged for the Canons of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, unto Monſieur <hi>Baluze;</hi> who hath inſerted them wholly in a Book of Monſieur de <hi>Marca</hi>'s, touching the Liberties of the <hi>Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican</hi> Church. In the third of theſe Canons this Ordinance is made,
<note place="margin">Apud Marc. de Concord. l. 8. c. 18. p. 344.</note> 
                     <hi>We expel out of the Church as Hereticks, and condemn thoſe, who making a ſhew of piety, do not approve the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of our Lord,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>We command all Secular Powers to puniſh them: and we bind with the ſame Bond of Excommunication thoſe which ſhall protect them, until ſuch time as they ſhall repent.</hi> This Canon, as far as I ſee, concerns only theſe <hi>Albigenſis;</hi> who not approving the Doctrine of the Latin Church upon the point of the Euchariſt, ſeparated themſelves from their Communion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it had condemned the Doctrine taught by <hi>Berengarius,</hi> and eſtabliſhed that of <hi>Paſchas</hi> in the XI. Century, although it had not admitted thereof before. And what confirms me in this Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, is what I find in the Chronicle of St. <hi>Tron,</hi> in the Country of <hi>Liege,</hi> touching <hi>Radolph,</hi> Abbot of that Monaſtery; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, Author of the Chronicle; <hi>viz.</hi> That being gone to <hi>Rome</hi> in Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the Second his time, who was advanced to this Dignity in the Year 1125. and held the Chair five years, he had a deſign to travel into another Country which he doth not name; but that he was informed, that it was infected with the Hereſie of the Sacramentarians; that is to ſay, the Doctrine which was condemned in the perſon of <hi>Berengarius.</hi> It adds, <hi>Moreover,

There was then at that time a Country, wherein Profeſſion was made of a Belief, contrary unto that of the Latin Church, in the point of the Sacrament; and becauſe this Abbot had received and approved the Deciſions of <hi>Leo, Victor, Nicholas,</hi> and of <hi>Gregory,</hi> againſt <hi>Berengari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and againſt his Doctrine, he calls the other Opinion Hereſie; and not only Hereſie, but the old Hereſie; this is the very term he uſeth; which ſheweth, that the Belief which he condemns, was no new Invention, according to the Judgment of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: but that it had of a long time been much ſpoken of, and that it was publickly profeſſed by great numbers of people, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the Country mentioned by him, which in all probabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was the Country of <hi>Languedock,</hi> wherein the followers of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius</hi> ſpread and publiſhed abroad his Doctrine, immediately after his death; not valuing the Prohibitions and Decrees of the Councils of <hi>Verceil,</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of <hi>Tours:</hi> On the contrary,
<pb n="472" facs="tcp:47504:239"/>ſeeing they authorized, and paſſed into an Article of Faith, an Opinion which they eſteemed to be Novel, and contrary unto the ancient Doctrine of Chriſtians, they ſeparated, and broke off from the Latin Church; in whoſe Communion they had lived till that time.</p>
                  <p>Theſe people had for their chief Conducter, <hi>Peter de Bruis;</hi> who, after having defended and maintained this Faith and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, having preached and publiſhed it for the ſpace of twenty years, in <hi>Languedock,</hi> in <hi>Gaſcoygne,</hi> and elſewhere, was at laſt Martyred and burnt at St. <hi>Giles</hi> in <hi>Languedock,</hi> by the care and diligence of the Latin Church; preferring rather to ſuffer death, and to ſeal with his Blood the Doctrine which he had taught, and which infinite numbers of people openly profeſſed, than to return unto the Communion which he had forſaken.</p>

                  <p>Five years after the death of <hi>Arnold</hi> of <hi>Breſs,</hi> according to the teſtimony of Hiſtorians, <hi>Peter Waldo,</hi> a Citizen of <hi>Lions</hi> appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; who having found whole Countries of people ſeparated from the Latin Church, he adhered unto them, with thoſe which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him, to make but one Body and Society, by the unity of the ſame Faith and Doctrine; they were no better uſed than the others had been: for <hi>Waldo</hi> having declared himſelf publickly, in
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:47504:240"/>the Year 1160. I find, that in the Year 1167. there was cauſed to be burnt at <hi>Vezelay</hi> in <hi>Burgundy,</hi> near unto <hi>Lyons,</hi> of which place <hi>Waldo</hi> was, ſome of his followers, under the name of <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narii,</hi> or <hi>Poplicani;</hi> which is one of the names given unto the <hi>Waldenſis;</hi> which, in all likelihood, was turned by the <hi>Flemings</hi> into that of <hi>Pifles;</hi> for ſo it is they were called in <hi>Flanders.</hi> The Hiſtory of <hi>Vezelay</hi> placeth the death of thoſe perſons,
<note place="margin">Tom. 3. Spicil. p. 644, 645.</note> which were ſeven in number, in the Year 1167. I know that all are not agreed of the time wherein <hi>Waldo</hi> began to appear, and that ſome make it to before the time we have mentioned. Nevertheleſs, becauſe the commoneſt and moſt received Opinion agrees, that he appeared about the Year 1160. we refer it thereunto, as to the moſt probable <hi>Epoch,</hi> and that which is moſt generally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto by Hiſtorians. But if all agree not of the time, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they agree of the perſonal Qualities of <hi>Waldo;</hi> ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting him to be ſtupid, ignorant and unlearned; and others, on the contrary, not denying him to be well learned. In this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of Opinions, it appears very reaſonable to prefer the teſtimony of thoſe which lived near that time, before ſuch as wrote a long while after; eſpecially, ſeeing there is nothing that ſhould ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the former to be ſuſpected: Therefore it is, that in this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion I give the preferrence unto <hi>Reynerus,</hi> of the Order of preaching Friars; becauſe he flouriſhed in the XIII. Century, about ninety years after <hi>Waldo</hi> began to preach. So that if he lived but twenty years after, then <hi>Reynerus</hi> wrote ſeventy years after his death. Beſides, <hi>Reynerus</hi> was a declared Enemy of the <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> againſt whom he wrote; there is no likelihood then that he would flatter <hi>Waldo,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Contra Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſ. c. 5.</note> nor attribute unto him what was not his Right. Now ſee what he ſaith; <hi>The Sect of the Poor of</hi> Lyons, <hi>which were alſo called</hi> Leoniſts, <hi>began thus: Some of the chiefeſt Citizens of</hi> Lyons <hi>being one day together, it happened that one of them died ſuddenly, in preſence of the reſt; which ſtruck ſuch a ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror into one of the Company, that immediately he diſtributed great trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures unto the Poor, ſo that very great multitudes of people followed him, whom he taught to profeſs voluntary poverty, and to imitate Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles: and having ſome competent knowledge of Letters, he taught them the New Teſtament in the Vulgar Tongue.</hi> It is a ſign, that if he underſtood not Greek, he, at leaſt, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood Latin enough to expound the Latin Tranſlation into the Language of the Country. Of this <hi>Waldo</hi> they were called <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſis;</hi> and of the City of <hi>Lyons,</hi> of which he was, <hi>Leoniſts,</hi> or the Poor of <hi>Lyons,</hi> as before they had been called <hi>Petrobruſians,</hi> from <hi>Peter de Bruis;</hi> and <hi>Henritians,</hi> of <hi>Henry:</hi> and of ſome other Doctors they had, they were called <hi>Arnoldiſts, Eſperoniſts,
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:47504:240"/>Joſephiſts, Lollards:</hi> others at ſeveral times, in ſeveral places, and on ſeveral occaſions, have called them <hi>Albigenſis, Tholouſians, Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cards, Poplicani</hi> or <hi>Pifles, Bogomiles, Bulgarians, Patarians, Inſaba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tas, Gazarians, Turlupians;</hi> and by ſeveral other names.</p>
                  <p>As for their Doctrine and Belief, even thoſe which have an averſion and hatred for their name and memory, do teſtifie that it was conformable unto that of the <hi>Albigenſis. The</hi> Waldenſis, <hi>ſaith</hi> Mariana, <hi>are the ſame with the</hi> Albigenſis,

                     <hi>That the holy Bread of Life Eternal, conſecrated by the Miniſtry of the Prieſt, and by the word of our Saviour, is not the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> A Declaration which fully juſtifies that it was the true Belief of the <hi>Albigenſis</hi> and <hi>Waldenſis;</hi> and ſheweth that they were deceived which ſaid, that they did not deny that the Euchariſt was the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt, but when him that celebrated and conſecrated was ſinful and unworthy to conſecrate: for they denied it ſimply and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely, without enquiring into the good or bad qualities of him that officiated. And the moſt conſiderable Doctors of the Latin Communion do confeſs, that they had the ſame Belief that <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rengarius</hi> had of the Sacrament: and it cannot juſtly be any way queſtioned, after all the many Teſtimonies which have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanced.</p>
                  <p>It is true that the <hi>Albigenſis</hi> and <hi>Waldenſis</hi> have been taxed and charged with many reproaches, and there has been many grievous Accuſations laid to their charge, both referring unto their Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine and their Manners. As to their Doctrine, I think that their Belief ought to be judged according to their Confeſſions of Faith; which being publick Declarations of their Opinions, makes all the Accuſations contrary thereunto, to be void; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we cannot judge of the Faith of a Society, and of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, but by the Confeſſion which it makes; to the prejudice whereof, nothing more can lawfully be charged upon it. It ſeems to me to be the true means, certainly to judge of the Belief of thoſe of whom we ſpeak, and of the Accuſations which have been laid to their charge. <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Cluny,</hi> writing againſt the <hi>Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruſians,</hi> that is to ſay, againſt the Diſciples of <hi>Peter de Bruis,</hi> or againſt the <hi>Albigenſis,</hi> ſaith, That the report is,
<note place="margin">Peter Cluny contra Petro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bruſ.</note> that they believe neither in Jeſus Chriſt, nor in the Prophets, nor Apoſtles; and that they deny the Old and New Teſtament, that they reject the whole Canon of the Scriptures.

                     <hi>What is not neceſſary in the Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of Baptiſm, are the Exorciſms, blowing, the ſign of the Croſs upon the breaſt and face of the Infant, the Salt which is put into the mouth, and the Spittle put into their ears and noſe,</hi> &amp;c. And about eighty or ninety years after <hi>Waldo</hi> began to appear, <hi>Reynerus,</hi> one of their greateſt Enemies,
<note place="margin">Cap 5. &amp; 3.</note> gives them this Teſtimony; <hi>They common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly have by heart the Text of the new Teſtament, and good part of the old; they have the old and new Teſtament tranſlated into the vulgar Tongue; and ſo they do teach and learn it. I ſaw and heard one of their Pea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, who repeated, word by word, the Book of</hi> Job; <hi>and ſeveral others of them, who repeated perfectly all the New Teſtament.</hi> And elſewhere;
<note place="margin">Cap. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>all other kind of Sects</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are monſtrous, by reaſon of the Blaſphemies which they audaciouſly offer againſt God: but as for the Sect of the</hi> Leoniſts (<hi>that is to ſay, the</hi> Waldenſis) <hi>they have a great appearance of piety, becauſe they live uprightly and juſtly in the ſight of Men, and have a ſound Belief for all that concerns God, and of all the Articles which are contained in the Creed.</hi> If thoſe people had good and ſound thoughts touching God, and a right Belief of all the Articles of the Apoſtle's Creed, as their very Adverſaries do confeſs, as well as their own Confeſſion of Faith, it is impoſſible they ſhould either be <hi>Arians,</hi> or <hi>Manicheans.</hi> It muſt then be ſaid, that thoſe which charged them with both theſe Hereſies, were very ill informed of their Belief. And to ſay the truth, <hi>Reynerus,</hi> their Perſecutor, hath ſpoken ſo much in their commendation, that he ſufficiently warrants them from the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piety of <hi>Manes,</hi> and the Hereſie of <hi>Arius.</hi> Alſo in the ſame Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe, he carefully diſtinguiſheth them from the <hi>Catharians,</hi> and <hi>Manicheans;</hi>

I will not here inſiſt upon their taxing the ſame <hi>Albigenſis</hi> and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſis,</hi> of denying Marriage; becauſe, beſides their poſitive De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration on this matter, their very Enemies confeſs, that they do even condemn the abuſe and intemperance of Marriage; ſo it is that <hi>Reynerus</hi> their perſecutor ſpeaks, who had often aſſiſted at their Examinations;
<note place="margin">Cap. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>They condemn Marriage</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in ſaying, that married perſons ſin mortally, if they marry without hopes of beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Children. Couſſard</hi> alſo makes this remark, <hi>They ſay that Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage is ſworn Adultery,

                  </p>
                  <p>Wherefore then, may it be asked, were the <hi>Albegenſis</hi> and <hi>Waldenſis</hi> accuſed by ſome of being <hi>Manicheans?</hi> for what ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance is there that they ſhould have been accuſed of this curſed Hereſie, if they had been no way guilty of it? Unto this the Proteſtants, which undertake to defend their Innocency, will not fail to anſwer, that it happened unto them as it did unto the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians, who were charged with grievous crimes, and unheard of wickedneſſes, although the World was never bleſſed with more pure and innocent Souls. The thing appears ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently by the teſtimonies of their very Enemies; who were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to confeſs they were neither <hi>Manicheans,</hi> nor <hi>Arians;</hi> but only Adverſaries of the Doctrine and Worſhip of the Latins; and ſo their Innocency it ſelf is ſufficiently vindicated, if it were ſo that we could not diſcover the motive of theſe Accuſations. Nevertheleſs, it is very probable they were induced to lay theſe Accuſations unto their charge, becauſe there was in their time in <hi>France,</hi> and elſewhere in the Weſt, great numbers of <hi>Maniche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Catharians, Arians,</hi> and other Hereticks; ſo that inhabiting many times in the ſame places, ſome through ignorance, as the common people; and others through Malice, as the Doctors; made no difficulty of charging them with the Impieties of theſe Hereticks, who lived at the ſame time, and in the ſame places: And it was ſo much the eaſier to make the people believe it, in ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Hereticks to be oppoſite unto the Latin Church, as well as the <hi>Albigenſis</hi> and <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> although by very different motives: that they eaſily thought they had been all united together againſt her; and by conſequence, of the ſame Belief, and of the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. It is true, that the ſame Authors which wrote againſt the <hi>Albigenſis</hi> and the <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> whom we have already mentioned, wrote alſo againſt the <hi>Catharians, Manicheans, Arians,</hi> and other
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:47504:243"/>Hereticks; which ſheweth that there were conſiderable numbers of them at the time that they wrote againſt the <hi>Waldenſis.</hi> And as for the <hi>Catharians</hi> and <hi>Manicheans</hi> in particular, we cannot doubt but that <hi>Italy, France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> was infected with them,

<note place="margin">Stat. Synod. c. 5. t. 6. Bibl. Pat.</note> 
                     <hi>Odo,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> made in one of his Synods certain Conſtitutions concerning the Sacrament; as, Of the manner of carrying it unto the Sick, Of the Adoration of thoſe which met it; Of keeping of it in the beſt part of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar, Of locking it up ſafe, with ſeveral precautions, in caſe it happened that any part of the Body or Blood of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould fall to the Ground,

                        </gap>o, 23, 24.</note> or if any Fly or Spider ſhould fall into the Blood. But becauſe moſt of theſe things do relate unto the Worſhip, we will omit ſpeaking of it, until we come to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wherein Chriſtians made their Worſhip and Devotion, in regard of the Sacrament, chiefly to conſiſt. I ſhall only ſay, that it was with <hi>Odo,</hi> as it happened unto ſeveral others after the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation of <hi>Berengarius:</hi> I mean, that they retained ſeveral an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient expreſſions, although the Doctrine was changed; and that ſince this Change happened, which is pretended to be at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the IX. Century, by <hi>Paſchas,</hi> and to have been eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by publick Authority in the XI. by ſome Popes in their Councils; theſe kinds of expreſſions do not very well agree, as many ſay, with the Belief of the Latins. For example; this precaution of <hi>Odo; If there falls to the Ground any part of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> becauſe, ſay the Proteſtants, the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers might very well ſay ſo, ſeeing they believed that the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt was Bread and Wine in ſubſtance, and the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt in Sacrament, and in vertue. But as for the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tins ſince <hi>Berengarius,</hi> they believe that it is the real Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; therefore they cannot reaſonably ſay, that any part of it falls to the ground, becauſe the ſubſtance it ſelf of the Body and Blood of the Son of God is not ſubject unto any ſuch accident.</p>
                  <p>Some Years after, that is to ſay, in the Year 1207. <hi>Amala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick,</hi> or <hi>Amaury</hi> of <hi>Chartres,</hi> was in great eſteem for his Learning, as <hi>Gaguinus</hi> reports, in his ſixth Book of the Hiſtory of <hi>France;</hi> and he teacheth, amongſt other things, <hi>That the Body of Jeſus Chriſt was not any more in the Bread of the Altar than in any other Bread, or in any thing elſe;</hi> denying Tranſubſtantiation; as <hi>Bernard</hi> of <hi>Luxemburg,
<note place="margin">Lib. 4. ad Ann. 1215.</note> Prateolus</hi> and <hi>Alphonſo de Caſtro</hi> have obſerved; and after them, <hi>Gennebrard</hi> in his Chronology. It is true, he was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of denying the Reſurrection of the Dead, Heaven and Hell; and of believing ſeveral other things which were not juſtifiable: but becauſe theſe Accuſations are brought by thoſe which appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:47504:245"/>not his Judgment touching the holy Sacrament, the Reader may judge what credit they ought to have againſt the memory of this Man, whilſt I ſhall obſerve that Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, in his Council of <hi>Lateran,</hi> in the Year 1145. condemned <hi>Amalarick,</hi> even after he was dead; and if we believe <hi>Gaguinus,</hi> he died of grief for having been forced to retract, but upon another Subject than that of the Sacrament, whereof this Hiſtorian maketh no mention; neither doth <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third declare for what Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror it was that he condemned him.

But I will inſiſt upon the conſideration of one thing which I cannot paſs over in ſilence, without prejudicing this Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory: it regards <hi>Guy le Groſs,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Narbonna;</hi> who going to viſit Pope <hi>Clement</hi> the Fourth, formerly his intimate
<pb n="487" facs="tcp:47504:246"/>friend, being at his Court, and there diſcourſing with a man of Learning, could not forbear declaring unto him his Opinion touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Euchariſt, which was directly contrary unto Tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation; whicy Pope <hi>Clement</hi> having underſtood after his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, wrote unto him, and repreſented, that he was of an ill per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, and that he muſt recant it. And it appears by this Pope's Letter, that the Arch-biſhop maintained, that this Opinion was very common amongſt the Doctors of <hi>Paris.</hi> The Letter was taken from the Regiſter of Manuſcript Letters of <hi>Clement</hi> the Fourth, about fourteen years ago. <hi>Aubertin,</hi> a Proteſtant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, inſerted it in the third Book of his Latin Treatiſe of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, it being communicated unto him by one of his friends; and I having been informed of late by a perſon of good Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who ſaw it before it was publiſhed by <hi>Aubertin,</hi> that it is for certain in the Regiſter, I will make no ſcruple of repreſenting it here in our Language, that the Reader might judge of what conſequence it is in regard of the matter which we examine.

                     <hi>The more ſincere our love is unto you, the more we have been touched in hearing certain things of you, which agree not with the gravity of your Office; conſidering eſpecially that they endanger your Dignity, and your Honour. I write unto you familiarly, and unknown unto any body, excepting him that writes the Letter, to let you know that I am informed, whilſt you were in our Court, and diſcourſed with a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Doctor touching the Sacrament of the Altar, you ſaid unto him, that the Body of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was not eſſentially in the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt, no otherwiſe than the thing ſignified is in the Sign: And that you ſaid, moreover, that this Opinion is in great eſteem at</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris. <hi>This diſcourſe being ſecretly whiſpered amongſt ſome perſons, and being at laſt come to our knowledge, I was much troubled at it; and I could ſcarce believe that you would have ſpoken things which contain manifeſt Hereſie, and which are contrary to the truth of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, wherein Faith doth operate with ſo much the more benefit, as it ſurpaſſeth Senſe, captivates the Underſtanding, and ſubjects Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon under its Laws. Therefore I counſel you not to be wiſer than you ſhould: and not to impute to the Doctors of</hi> Paris, <hi>Opinions which they believe not; but that you humbly confeſs, and firmly believe what the Church believeth, and what the Saints preach and teach,</hi> viz. <hi>That the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, although he be locally in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is truly, really and eſſentially, under the Species of Bread and Wine, after the Prieſt hath pronounced the ſacred words, according to the uſage of the Church. And if by hazard you remember him or them, unto whom you have ſaid it, revoke it either verbally, or by wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to the end that thoſe which ſuppoſe that you believe what ought
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:47504:247"/>not to be believed of this great Myſtery, might harbour no ill Opinion of you.</hi> At <hi>Viterba,</hi> the 5th of the Calends of <hi>November, Anno</hi> the 3d. that is, of his Popedom; which anſwers unto the Year of our Lord, 1268. This Prelate being diſheartned at the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Letter, and fearing the loſs of his Office and Honour, denies having ſpoken what the Pope taxed him with; and under obſcure and intricate terms, made profeſſion of believing what the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> believed concerning this Myſtery; yet in ſuch a manner, that he ſaith certain things which agree not very well with this Doctrine,
<note place="margin">In Regiſtro E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. Clemen. ſupra cit. Ep. 519.</note> and which ſeem to teſtifie that this Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Narbona</hi> dared not freely to declare his thoughts. <hi>The Body of Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is underſtood four ſeveral ways:</hi> 1. <hi>It is ſo called in regard of the reſemblance, as the Species of Bread and Wine, and that improperly.</hi> 2. <hi>It is taken for the material Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, which was crucified and pierced with a Lance, and which was firſt taken from the bleſſed Virgin: and this ſignification is proper.</hi> 3. <hi>For the Church, or for its myſtical Unity.</hi> 4. <hi>For the ſpiritual Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, which is Meat indeed. And it is ſaid of thoſe which eat this Fleſh ſpiritually, that they do receive the truth of the Fleſh and Blood of our Saviour.</hi> This Prelate maketh a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of the ſpiritual Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt which he propoſeth as the Food of Believers, from the Fleſh of our Lord, taken pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, and in its true ſignification: I cannot tell if his Opinion and Judgment may not thereby be determined; which I leave un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others to do. Whereas it is read in the Pope's Letter unto this Arch-Biſhop, that he ſaid that his Opinion, contrary to the Doctrine of the Real Preſence, was famous and frequent at <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris,</hi> it is not without great probability, if it be conſidered that two years after, that is to ſay, <hi>Anno</hi> 1270. which was the year of the death of St. <hi>Lewis; Stephen,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> condemned, by advice of the Doctors of Divinity, thoſe which held, 1. <q>That God doth not make the Accident to ſubſiſt without its Subject,
<note place="margin">Tom 4. Bibl. Pat. p. 924.</note> becauſe it is of his Eſſence, that it ſhould be actually in its ſubject. 2. That the Accident without a Subject, is not an Accident, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be equivocal. 3. That to make the Accident be without the Subject, as we believe it is in the Sacrament, is a thing im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, and implies a Contradiction. 4. That God cannot make the Accident to be without the Subject, nor that there ſhould be ſeveral dimenſions together.</q> Maxims which being inconſiſtent with Tranſubſtantiation, declare, if I miſtake not, that thoſe which held them were far from believing it; which I refer to the judgment of the Reader, contenting my ſelf in warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him,
<note place="margin">Tom. 2. Spicil. p. 795. anno 1236.</note> that inſtead of the Year 1227. which is marked at the beginning of this <hi>Anathema,</hi> it ſhould be the Year 1270. that
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:47504:247"/>about thirty years before, to wit, the Year 1236. there were taken in divers parts of <hi>France, Flanders, Champaigne, Burgundy,</hi> and other Provinces, great numbers of <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> under the names of <hi>Bulgarians</hi> and <hi>Pifles;</hi> and that all thoſe which would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce their Faith were burnt alive, and their Goods confiſcated, as the Chronicle of St. <hi>Medard</hi> of <hi>Soiſſons</hi> doth teſtifie; where it is obſerved, that before that time it was ſo practiſed for three whole years together, and that the ſame courſe was held the five years following without intermiſſion; to wit, until the Year 1241.</p>
                  <p>What I have now ſaid of the Letter of <hi>Clement</hi> the Fourth, unto the Arch-biſhop of <hi>Narban,</hi> and that of this Prelate unto the Pope, and of the Condemnation of certain Maxims which were condemned by <hi>Stephen,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> will receive much light from the Hiſtory of what paſſed in the Univerſity of <hi>Paris</hi> in the Year of our Lord, 1304. And ſee here what it is.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> of the Order of Preaching Friars, that is, of Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minicans, taught a manner of exiſting of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament of the Altar, different from that which was commonly received in the Latin Church. He does not indeed condemn the manner of exiſting of the Converſion of Bread in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which was the Opinion generally received amongſt the Latins; but he pretends that it is no Article of Faith, not having been determined by the Church no more than that which he meant to eſtabliſh; and that therefore it was at every bodies free choice to embrace either the one or the other, although he judged his ſafeſt, and ſubject unto leſs inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. And he makes it conſiſt in the Aſſumption of the Bread by the Divinity, and in that the ſubſtance of Bread remains in the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Thereby he explains the Retractation they made <hi>Berengarius</hi> make under <hi>Nicholas</hi> the Second; to wit, <hi>That the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is broken by the hands of the Prieſt, and ground by the teeth of Believers; not only in Sacrament, but in the verity it ſelf.</hi> And he explains it in ſaying, that this ſhould be underſtood by the Bread which was taken by the Divinity; although that by a Communication of Idioms, what befalls the Bread, ſhould be attributed unto the Body of Jeſus Chriſt. It is by this ſame Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of Idioms that he explains theſe words; <hi>The Bread is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the eating of his Fleſh:</hi> for he pretends that the glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Fleſh of our Saviour cannot be eaten, it being immortal. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro Chriſti glorificata non eſt manducabilis, impaſſibilis exiſtens.</hi> And anſwering this Objection which might be made againſt him, That
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:47504:248"/>if the ſubſtance of Bread remained in the Sacrament of the Altar, as he did teach, it would follow that it ſhould be adored with the worſhip of Latrie, which would be more Idolatry: he ſaith, it would be Idolatry, if the Bread were adored in its own form (that is to ſay, in it ſelf;) but that there is no Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, being adored in another (that is to ſay) in the Divinity, which hath taken it and hath united it unto it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>But what I find more remarkable in this Hiſtory is, that the Faculty of Divinity of <hi>Paris</hi> did not condemn the Sentiment of this Doctor; on the contrary, it formally declared, that it held for a probable Opinion both the one and the other manner of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king exiſt the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament. I ſay, that which <hi>John of Paris</hi> eſtabliſhed, and the other which depended on the change of the ſubſtance of Bread into the ſubſtance of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt; that it approved of both the one and the other; ſaying nevertheleſs, that neither of theſe two ways had yet been determined by the Church, and that neither of them, by conſequence, was an Article of Faith: that if this Doctor had ſpoke otherwiſe, he had ſpoke amiſs; and that thoſe which ſpeak otherwiſe, do not ſay well; and that whoſoever ſhould affirm definitively, that either the one or the other of theſe two man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sacrament ſhould pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely be eſteemed matter of Faith, that is, that it is a point of Faith, ſhould incurr Sentence of Excommunication.</p>
                  <p>And the more particularly to ſatisfie the Reader's curioſity, I will recite in proper terms the Title of this little Treatiſe of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> his deſign, his proteſtation, and the Judgment of the Faculty of Divinity; to the end he may conſider what was in that time the diſpoſition of Chriſtians in the Weſt in regard of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and how the moſt famous of all Faculties of Divinity did eſteem that the Church had not yet determined any thing touching the manner of the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in this My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. But firſt of all, I muſt inform the Reader, that what we are going to alledge, was taken out of a Manuſcript which is in the Library of St. <hi>Victor</hi> of <hi>Paris;</hi> the which is well known unto ſeveral perſons which have ſeen it as well as my ſelf; and hath for Title what follows.</p>

                  <p>It appears by what hath been ſaid, eſpecially by the Judgment of the Faculty of Divinity, that it was not believed at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the XIV. Century, that the Doctrine of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation was an Article of Faith, notwithſtanding the Decree of <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third, at the Council of <hi>Lateran, Anno</hi> 1215. and no more but a probable Opinion: and that it was in every bodies free liberty to follow it, or not. Which will not a little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Proteſtants in the belief they are in, that the Doctrine of the Real Preſence did not paſs into an Article of Faith, until the Council of <hi>Trent;</hi> after the Ordinances whereof, they eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that there was an indiſpenſable neceſſity of ſeparating from the Communion of the Latins; and will make them at the ſame time ſay, that this ſole Conſideration which we have made upon the Hiſtory of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> is ſufficient entirely to ruin the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two famous Books which have appeared of late years, wherein they have pretended to ſhew that Tranſubſtantiation has always been eſteemed in the Church to be an Article of Faith. And there is no queſtion but they are much confirmed in this Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent, when they ſhall ſee that the Cardinal <hi>d'Aylli,</hi> which aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted at the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> at the beginning of the XV.

                  <p>But having reported what paſſed in the Weſt during the XII. and XIII. Centuries touching the holy Sacrament, according un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to our method, it will not be amiſs to ſay ſomething touching the Eaſtern Church. <hi>Genebrard</hi> in his Chronologies makes mention of a certain Friar called <hi>Baſil,</hi> of whom he obſerves, <hi>That he re-eſtabliſhed the Error of</hi> Berengarius; for although he ſpeaks of the year 1087. nevertheleſs,
<note place="margin">Ad annum 1087.</note> according to the teſtimony of <hi>Zonarus,</hi> reported by Cardinal <hi>Baronius,</hi> he dogmatized for the ſpace of 52 years, we may put him into the number of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of the XII. Century. It is true, the ſame <hi>Zonarus</hi> reports in <hi>Baronius,</hi> that the Emperor <hi>Alexius Comeneus</hi> cauſed him to be burnt as an Impoſtor; ſo that if he was put to death for the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions which <hi>Genebrard</hi> imputes unto him touching the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it cannot reaſonably be doubted, but the Greek Church was in the XII. Century, of the ſame belief that the Latin Church was of; But ſeeing this man was accuſed of ſeveral Impieties,
<note place="margin">Apud Baron. ad annum 1118. N. 27.</note> as of denying the Trinity, of rejecting the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> of teaching that the World was made by wicked Angels, that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chael</hi> the Archangel was Incarnate; of denying the Reſurrection, and of holding many other things alike wicked and abominable: I ſuppoſe that as the Proteſtants can draw no advantage in favour of their Opinion from the belief of this man, if it be true that he believed what <hi>Genebrard</hi> relates of him; ſo in like manner, have the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks no cauſe to boaſt of his Condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which was grounded upon ſeveral Impieties, which ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently declare that he was a <hi>Manichean. Leo Allatius</hi> repreſents this <hi>Baſil</hi> as Chief of the Sect of the <hi>Bogomiles,</hi> whoſe Hereſie was compoſed of that of the <hi>Manicheans</hi> and <hi>Meſſalians;</hi> and what this Author ſaith of them, may be ſeen in the ſecond Book <hi>De perpetua conſenſione Orientis &amp; Occidentis,</hi> cap. 10. p. 636.</p>
                  <p>But at the beginning of the XIII. Century, the mind of the Greeks was extreamly agitated upon the ſubject of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſome affirming, that the Myſteries were corruptible; others juſtifying the contrary. The reaſon of theſe latter was, becauſe the holy Sacrament is a Commemoration of our Lord's being riſen again for us; alledging to this purpoſe, ſome paſſages of the Fathers, which ſeemed to favour their Opinion. But the others, on the contrary, denied that the Sacrament was a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, ſaying, it was only
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:47504:250"/>a Sacrifice, and by conſequence, he was therein corruptible, as before his Paſſion, and without Life and Soul. I ſaid that the Spirits of men was much agitated at the beginning of the XIII. Age; for the Diſpute had already been begun, even in the XII. Century.</p>
                  <p>Therefore <hi>Zonarus</hi> a Greek Friar who lived at that time, I mean in the XII. Century, ſpeaks of it in one of his Letters, and reſolves the queſtion in embracing both parties.
<note place="margin">In notis Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>canii ad Cyril. Alexandr. t. 6. libr. adverſus Antropomorp ex Zonara, ep. 32. L. 3. de robus geſtis Alexii.</note> He ſaid, That the Bread is the Fleſh it ſelf of Jeſus Chriſt mortal and buried; and for this reaſon it is corruptible, ground and broken to pieces by the Teeth; but that afterwards being chewed, eaten, and gone down into the Stomach, as it were into a Sepulchre, it becomes incorruptible, becauſe the Body of our Lord remained not long dead and buried, but roſe again ſoon after. As for <hi>Nicetas Choniates,</hi> who wrote juſt at the beginning of the XIII. Century, and that makes mention of this Diſpute; he ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly teſtifieth, that the Patriarch <hi>Camaterus</hi> embraced the Opinion of thoſe which maintained, that the Myſteries were corruptible. I ſhall not examine which of the two parties were moſt reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; for to ſpeak my thoughts plainly, thoſe people ſtrove in vain and to no purpoſe, after curious queſtions, fit rather to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gender ſtrifes and quarrels, than to edifie and inſtruct Chriſtians. I ſhall only deſire the Reader ſeriouſly to conſider, if either or both of theſe Opinions, can agree or hold with the Doctrine of the Latins; for thoſe which held that the Myſteries were incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, alledge for their reaſon, <hi>That the Sacrament is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion and Commemoration of the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſaying that it is the glorified Body it ſelf of our Lord: And the others which affirm that it is corruptible, ſay, <hi>That the Bread of the Sacrament is the dead Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> which cannot be in the reality of the thing, becauſe all Chriſtians do confeſs, that our Lord dyeth no more; and that his ſtate of Death and Crucifiction, hath been paſt above XVI. Ages ago; whereby may be judged the diſpoſition of <hi>Zonarus,</hi> which held of both ſides, and of the ſtrange manner wherein he explains himſelf.</p>
                  <p>I know not if I ſhould make mention of one <hi>Samonas</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Gaza,</hi> who is placed in the XIII. Century; for all do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his teſtimony, which is wholly favourable unto that of the cauſe of the Latins, ſeeing he ſaith in a Diſpute againſt <hi>Achmet</hi> a <hi>Sarrazin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tom. 12. Bibl. patr. p. 524, 525, 526.</note> touching the Euchariſt, <hi>That the Bread and Wine are not the Antitypes of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, but that they are by Conſecration changed into the real Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; and that the Diviſion which is made,</hi> (to wit, by means
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:47504:250"/>of breaking it) <hi>is of ſenſible Accidents.</hi> Were there nothing to be objected in the Nature of a Witneſs, it could not be denied but this Greek Biſhop was of the Belief of the Latin Church. But the Proteſtants do deny that ever there was any ſuch Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute; affirming, That no Author hath made any mention of this <hi>Samonas,</hi> becauſe at that time there was no Greek Biſhop at <hi>Gaza,</hi> nor in all <hi>Pallaſtine,</hi> being poſſeſſed by the <hi>Sarrazens,</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving expell'd the Latins; which had before ſetled Biſhops of their own Language. And in fine, becauſe the greateſt part of this Writing was taken word for word from the Diſpute of <hi>Anaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> the <hi>Sinaite,</hi> againſt the <hi>Gaianites;</hi> whereof mention hath been made in the Hiſtory of the VII. Century. Whereunto may be added, that this pretended <hi>Samonas,</hi> ſpeaketh formally of the Union of the Bread and Wine, unto the Divinity, which is juſt the Opinion of <hi>John Damaſcen;</hi> as alſo what he ſaith,
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 525.</note> that the Bread and Wine is taken, that is to ſay, that the Divinity joyns and unites them unto it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>All the Proteſtants do not indeed ſay, that there was not any Greek Biſhop in all <hi>Pallaſtine</hi> in the XIII. Century; but they all agree to ſay, That it belongs to the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks to prove that there was at that time at <hi>Gaza</hi> a Greek Biſhop called <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monas,</hi> ſeeing they produce him as a Witneſs; and is ſuch a Witneſs as no Writer makes any mention of.</p>
                  <p>In the ſame Tome of the Library of the Holy Fathers, there is a Confeſſion of Faith made by <hi>Nicetas</hi> in the XIII. Century in favour of thoſe which ſhould be converted from Mahumetiſm unto the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, wherein he ſaith,

                     <q>That Chriſtians do ſacrifice Myſtically, Bread and Wine; and that they participate thereof in the Divine Myſteries.</q> He adds nevertheleſs, <q>That he believes, they are alſo truly the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, having been changed by his Divine Power in a Spiritual and Inviſible manner, above and beyond all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural comprehenſion, only known unto himſelf. And it is ſo alſo <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that I intend to participate thereof, for the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifying of Body and Soul, for Life Eternal, and for inheriting the Kingdom of Heaven.</q> This Author ſaith, That what Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſacrifice and receive at the Holy Table, is Bread and Wine; that this Bread and Wine are in truth the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, having been changed by his Divine Power, not unto all Communicants indifferently, but only for them which Communicate with a true and ſincere Faith: Let the belief of this man be gueſſed at, after all this.</p>
                  <p>But now I call to mind that I had almoſt forgot two Witneſſes of the Greek Church of the XII. Century; one of the Ages,
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:47504:251"/>whoſe Hiſtory we examine in this Chapter, to wit, <hi>Euthymius</hi> and <hi>Zonarus;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In Matth. 26.</note> The firſt ſaith thus, <q>Our Lord did not ſay, Theſe are the Signs of my Body and of my Blood;</q> but he ſaid, <hi>This is my Body and Blood.</hi> And again, <q>As our Saviour Deified the Fleſh which he aſſumed ſupernaturally, ſo alſo he changeth theſe things into his quickning Body.</q> Words which <hi>Roman</hi> Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks mightily prize and value, thinking that they favour their Hypotheſis. But it muſt not be concealed alſo, that in another Treatiſe, <hi>Euthymius</hi> teſtifies, that he follows the Opinion of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſcen</hi> touching the Sacrament; alledging to this effect a great paſſage out of his 4th Book of Orthodox Faith.
<note place="margin">Panopl. part 2. titul. 21.</note> Now the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Damaſcen</hi> was neither that of the <hi>Roman</hi> Catholicks nor the Proteſtants, as hath been ſhewed in the 12th Chapter. And <hi>Euthemius</hi> ſeems to aſſure ſo much in the words but now alledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when he compares the change befallen unto the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt, unto that happened unto the Humane Nature of Jeſus Chriſt, when it was taken into the Unity of one perſon by the Eternal Word; beſides that in the ſame place, whence both the mentioned paſſages were taken, he ſaid, <hi>That not the nature of the things propoſed ſhould be conſidered, but their vertue;</hi> which ſhews, that he believed with <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> that the ſubſtance of the Symbols do remain.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Zonarus,</hi> another Greek Friar; we have already ſeen how he embraced as well the ſide of thoſe which held that the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries were corruptible, as thoſe which ſuppoſed them to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corruptible; beſides, he expoundeth elſewhere the 32.

                  <p>DUring the Papacy of <hi>Boniface</hi> the VIII. who had ſo great a conteſt with <hi>Philip</hi> the Fair, one of our Kings, there was in <hi>Italy</hi> great numbers of <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> who were called <hi>Fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telli,</hi> becauſe they ſtiled themſelves Brethren, as the Primitive Chriſtians, who frequently ſo denominated themſelves, where it was, that the whole Body of the Church was called the Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therhood; and what induces me to believe that theſe <hi>Fratellis</hi> were <hi>Waldenſis</hi> and <hi>Albigenſis,</hi> many of whom retired themſelves into the Vallies of <hi>Piedmont,</hi> at the time that <hi>Waldo</hi> and his Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herents were driven away from <hi>Lyons,</hi> is, that an uncertain Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor which wrote againſt them, when they were moſt ſpoken of, and which is Printed with <hi>Reynerius</hi> and <hi>Pilichdorffius,</hi> obſerves amongſt other things, that they called themſelves Brethren;

                  <p>I will only obſerve, that beſides the <hi>Waldenſis</hi> and <hi>Albigenſis,</hi> there was at <hi>Herbipolis,</hi> about the year 1340. one <hi>Conrad Hagar,</hi> who as appears by the Bull of <hi>Otho,</hi> Biſhop of the place, as <hi>Hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinian</hi> obſerves, <hi>confeſſed that during the ſpace of</hi> 24 <hi>years,

                  <p>The Doctrine of <hi>Wickliff</hi> did not expire with his perſon; for <hi>Nicholas Herreford,</hi> Doctor in Divinity, defended thoſe which were his followers, and which profeſſed the Doctrine which he had taught, as
<note place="margin">1 In Ricard. II. ad an. 1387.</note> 
                     <hi>Walſingham</hi> doth write;
<note place="margin">2 Ad an. 1389. in Hypodigm.

                  <p>At the ſame time there were ſeveral <hi>Waldenſis</hi> at the Straits of the <hi>Alps,</hi> which divide <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Italy;</hi> as we are informed by

                  <p>The XV.

                     <hi>Walſingham</hi> doth teſtifie. But notwithſtanding all this they loſt not their courage, nor abandoned the Doctrine they had until then profeſſed. On the contrary, the
<note place="margin">5 In Henr.

<note place="margin">In Prolog. t. 2. doct. 11. &amp; ad initium prolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gi.</note> ſaying, <hi>That Prince pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded according to the Command of Jeſus Chriſt; who nevertheleſs, requires not Conſciences to be forced, but perſuaded; and whoſe Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is made up of love, and of mildneſs.</hi>

                  <p>But whilſt theſe things were acting in <hi>England,</hi> there was in <hi>Bohemia</hi> infinite numbers of people that made open profeſſion of the ſame Doctrine, for which the <hi>Lollards</hi> were perſecuted in <hi>Great Britain;</hi> for beſides the <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> which had retired them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves thither a great while before, by reaſon of the Perſecution ſtirred up againſt them in <hi>Picardy;</hi> as <hi>Dubravius,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Ol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muz,</hi> informed us in the precedent Chapter. At the beginning of this Century, there was made in that Country a conſiderable Separation from the Roman Church, according to the Teſtimony of the ſame <hi>Dubravius,</hi> and of <hi>Eneas Silvius,</hi> in their Hiſtories of <hi>Bohemia.</hi> 'Tis true, this Separation was not alike in all; for ſome only deſired the Reſtitution of the Cup unto the people, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of accord in all other points with the Latins; and thoſe, for this reaſon were called <hi>Calixtins:</hi> but as for the others, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>owned the ſame Doctrine of the Communion of the Latins, which the <hi>Waldenſis</hi> and <hi>Wickliffites</hi> had oppoſed, and did ſtill oppoſe; and becauſe, as ſome alledge, theſe latter joyned themſelves unto the <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> which had been ſetled a long time in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and uſed to aſſemble themſelves in the Mountain of <hi>Tabor,</hi> they were called <hi>Taborites;</hi> as <hi>Dubravius</hi> hath obſerved. But let us hear what this Prelate intends to ſay touching this Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when having ſpoken of the Jubilee celebrated at <hi>Prague,</hi> in the Year 1400. he adds, <hi>Unto this time the Chriſtian Religion,
<note place="margin">Lib. 23. hiſt.

<note place="margin">Ibid. l. 24.</note> that in the City of</hi> Prague <hi>there reſted no ſign of the ancient Catholick Religion.</hi> Alſo the Friar <hi>Walſingham</hi> teſtifies, that the Emperor <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from <hi>Conſtance,</hi> into his own Territories, after the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil had elected Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the Fifth,

                     <hi>To employ all his ſtrength to ruin the Enemies of Religion, and the Hereſie of the</hi> Lollards, <hi>which were mightily increaſed in the Kingdom of</hi> Bohemia, <hi>by the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warmneſs and ſupport of his elder Brother. Dubravius</hi> proceedeth farther; for after the Coronation of <hi>Sigiſmond</hi> at <hi>Prague,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ubi ſupra l. 26</note> he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth the Tenets of the <hi>Taborites,</hi> but after a manner that is not exactly conformable unto their Confeſſion of Faith; by which, nevertheleſs, their Belief ought to be judged; becauſe it is in thoſe publick Acts, that for the moſt part is declared what is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in matters of Religion. And treating of <hi>Moravia,</hi> upon
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:47504:255"/>the Year 1421. he obſerves, that Country was not then infected with the Hereſie of the <hi>Taborites;</hi> but in that ſame year, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan there to eſtabliſh themſelves; <hi>Renewing</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the ancient Error of the</hi> Picards (<hi>that is to ſay, of the</hi> Waldenſis) <hi>to wit, that none ought to kneel unto the Sacrament of the Altar, becauſe the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is not there; having aſcended up into Heaven, both in Body and Soul; and that there remains only the Bread and Wine.</hi> I know very well that the Biſhop of <hi>Olmuz</hi> chargeth them in the ſame place, of teaching that the Bread and Wine of the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt is ſuch Bread and Wine as each particular amongſt the people may take with their own hands: that the hand of the Prieſt is no more worthy then that of a private Lay perſon: <hi>And to vomit</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>other Blaſphemies againſt the real Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> But becauſe the quite contrary doth appear by their Confeſſion of Faith, I know not whether it would be reaſonable to admit of this Accuſation, coming from the Pen and hand of an Enemy.</p>

<note place="margin">Confeſſ. Tabor. Joan. Lukavits</note> that their Belief touching the Euchariſt is, <hi>That the Bread remains in its nature true Bread; and that it is the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, not by a material Identity, but Sacramentally, really and truly.</hi> Then they reject the Opinion of thoſe which ſay. That the ſame Body of Jeſus Chriſt which is in Heaven, is alſo in the Sacrament,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> with all its eſſential and accidental Proprieties; <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe</hi> (ſay they) <hi>this would be a means to preſuppoſe, that the ſubſtance of Bread ſhould ceaſe to be, and that it ſhould be converted ſubſtantial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Body of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Moreover, they formally deny the Adoration of the Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>John Hus</hi> was of the ſame Opinion of thoſe which were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Taborites,</hi> it muſt be owned, after ſo expreſs a Declaration as
<pb n="505" facs="tcp:47504:255"/>they made, that he oppoſed the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantion. If we give credit unto what is reported in the Acts of the Council of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> we cannot queſtion but that he was contrary unto this Doctrine. In fine, The Council doth condemn thirty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of <hi>John Hus;</hi> in the
<note place="margin">1 Concil. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. ſeſſ. 15.</note> twenty fifth whereof they make him ſay, that he doth approve of forty Articles of <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s; the
<note place="margin">2 Ibid. ſeſſ. 8.</note> three firſt whereof are directly contrary unto Tranſubſtantiation. Moreover, there is to be found in the Proceedings made againſt him, that he had preached and taught,
<note place="margin">3 Ibid. ſeſſ. 15.</note> 
                     <hi>That after conſecrating the Hoſt at the Altar, the material Bread did remain; that the ſubſtance of Bread remains after Conſecration, and that the Opinion which the Church holdeth of the Sacrament of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, is erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious.</hi> Therefore Pope <hi>Martin</hi> the Fifth,
<note place="margin">Ad finem Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil. Conſtant.</note> in his Bull of Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the Council, doth not fail of repreſenting <hi>John Hus,</hi> as approving the Articles of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> before ſpoken of.
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares alſo, that <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> was of the ſame Judgment; that is to ſay, in an Opinion contrary unto the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> which the Council doth alſo obſerve, in the twenty firſt
<note place="margin">1 Ibid. ſeſſ. 21.</note> Seſſion. And <hi>Gobellin Perſona,</hi> Official of the Dioceſs of
<note place="margin">2 Coſmodrom. a tat. 6. c. 95.</note> 
                     <hi>Peterborough,</hi> who lived at that time, thought that he ought not to ſay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, after the Declaration of the Pope, and of the Council. But if we conſult the Works of <hi>John Hus,</hi> printed at <hi>Noremberg, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>no</hi> 1558. with his Martyrdom; and that of <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> for ſo it is that their death is therein ſtyled; we ſhall find that he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways believed the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, and that of Concomitance: and the reading of <hi>Wickliff</hi>'s Works, for whom he had an extraordinary kindneſs; calling him always, <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lical Doctor;</hi> could never make him alter his mind, nor work up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſpirit the ſame effects which it wrought upon the <hi>Taborites.</hi> In fine, in his Treatiſe <hi>Of the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, againſt the falſe Appariſions of it,</hi> which at that time was frequently publiſhed in all parts, he ſaid,
<note place="margin">Tom. 1. fol. 155</note> 
                     <hi>That the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt is in the Sacrament, truly and really, after what manner ſoever it ought to be here below in the Church; that is to ſay</hi> (as appears by the ſcope of the whole Diſcourſe) <hi>inviſibly,</hi> and not <hi>viſibly;</hi> as the Autors of theſe miraculous Apparations would have it be believed. And in the ſame Treatiſe,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> he accuſeth of Incredulity thoſe which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved not what he ſaid of the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. He ſuppoſed,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>That Accidents do ſubſiſt without their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject in the Sacrament:</hi> confeſſeth that there is no contradiction in ſaying, <hi>That the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is here ſacramentally,
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 156. Ibid. p. 158. Ibid. fol. 161.</note> and at the ſame time in Heaven locally.</hi> He affirms for truth, <hi>that his Blood is truly and really in the Sacramen:</hi> confeſſeth, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is hidden in the Sacrament.</hi> And amongſt many Inconveniences
<pb n="506" facs="tcp:47504:256"/>which he fears theſe feigned Apparitions of the Blood of Chriſt might produce,
<note place="margin">Ibid. fol. 162.</note> he puts this down as the fifth; <hi>That it may be, there are ſome which queſtion whether the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt be in the venerable Sacrament, becauſe it doth not viſibly appear unto them.</hi> And a little after, he ſaith, <hi>That we adore the Body and Blood of of Jeſus Chriſt, which is at the right hand of his Father, and in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Sacrament made by the Prieſts.</hi> The ſame man writeth in his Treatiſe of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Id. t. 1. fol. 164.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Doctrine of</hi> Beren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garius <hi>is a great Hereſie.</hi> He receiveth for a true teſtimony of St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>'s, a paſſage of <hi>Lanfranc,</hi> a ſworn Enemy of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> which the Canoniſt <hi>Gratian</hi> cites in his Decree, under the name of St. <hi>Auſtin.</hi> In a word, in this little Treatiſe, he embraceth and follows all that the Latins believe of the Sacrament of the Altar. And that it ſhould not be imagined that he changed his Opinion, it is to be obſerved, that amongſt ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral little Treatiſes which he compoſed during his Impriſonment at <hi>Conſtance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Cap. 2. p. 32. t. 1</note> there is one, <hi>Of the Sacrament of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> written, <hi>Anno</hi> 1415. wherein he teacheth the ſame Doctrine;
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> declaring moreover, <hi>That all that the Church of</hi> Rome <hi>believes of the venerable Sacrament, ought to be believed. That he had preached this Doctrine from the beginning, unto that day.</hi> And in fine,
<note place="margin">Ibid. fol. 49. Ibid. fol. 40. c. 3</note> 
                     <hi>That he believed Tranſubſtantiation: And</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I never taught, that the ſubſtance of material Bread remained in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Altar.</hi> He adds a little after, <hi>That the Body and Blood of our Saviour remains in the Sacrament, as long as the Species of Bread and Wine do ſubſiſt.</hi> In another little Treatiſe, wherein he examines whether Lay-perſons ſhould receive under both kinds, he lays it down for a truth, <hi>That the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt is under both ſpecies of the Sacrament;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>that he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely under the ſpecies of Bread, and entirely under that of Wine.</hi> He that writ the Hiſtory of <hi>John Hus,</hi> particularly, the conflicts he was to ſuffer at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> and at the which he ſaith he was preſent;
<note place="margin">Tom. 1. fol. 9.</note> reports a publick Teſtimony of the Univerſity of <hi>Prague,</hi> touching the purity of the Belief of this man; wherein is decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that <hi>Hus</hi> had denied the things whereof he had been accuſed unto the Pope; eſpecially, that he had ever taught, <hi>That the material ſubſtance of Bread remained in the Sacrament of the Altar.</hi> The Author alſo reporteth,
<note place="margin">Ibid. fol. 12.</note> that <hi>John Hus</hi> was heard in open Council, the 7th of <hi>June;</hi> and that he confeſſed, <hi>That the Bread is tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated; and that the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which was born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>which ſuffered, and was crucified,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>is truly, really, and wholly in the Sacrament:</hi> And, as a certain Engliſh Man ſaid, that <hi>Hus</hi> diſguiſed his Opinion juſt as <hi>Wickliff</hi> had formerly done in <hi>England;</hi> he anſwered, <hi>That he ſpake ſincerely, and from his heart.</hi>
                     <pb n="507" facs="tcp:47504:256"/>Which need not much be queſtioned, when it muſt be obſerv'd,
<note place="margin">Tom. 2. ſo. 344.</note> that <hi>Hus</hi> was a man full of candor and ſincerity. It is related in the acts of his Paſſion (for that's the Title given them in his Works) that theſe things but now mentioned, and others of the like Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are reported of him. But beſides theſe proofs, there is alſo found amongſt <hi>John Hus</hi> his Letters, <hi>Num.</hi> 65.
<note place="margin">Tom. 1. fol. 8.</note> a very favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble teſtimony given by the Univerſity of <hi>Prague</hi> unto him and <hi>Jerom,</hi> after their Death, that is to ſay, the 23d. of <hi>May, Anno</hi> 1416. and in <hi>Num.</hi> 66. a Summary of the belief of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minalty of <hi>Prague,</hi> compoſed of the followers of <hi>John Hus,</hi> wherein they formally eſtabliſh the Doctrine of Tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, and the Concomitants, ſaying, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt gave unto his Diſciples his Body and Blood, miraculouſly hid under the Species of Bread and Wine.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ib. num. 66.</note> And alledging a paſſage under the name of <hi>Leo,</hi> which imports, <hi>That the Blood is received with the Body under the ſpecies of Bread; and the Body with the Blood under the ſpecies of Wine; that nevertheleſs, the Blood is not eaten under the ſpecies of Bread, as the Bread is not drank under that of Wine.</hi> I will add (to conclude) unto all theſe conſiderations, two other circumſtances: In the firſt place, that the <hi>Taborites,</hi> which had a great Veneration for <hi>John Hus,</hi> although they were of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Judgment unto him upon the point of the Sacrament, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion him often in their Confeſſion of Faith upon the Articles which he either held or favoured; but upon the point of Tranſubſtantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on they alledge nothing of his. In the ſecond place, that in regard of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> who was much eſteemed by <hi>Hus,</hi> he declares poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively in his Writings, againſt <hi>Stephen Palets,</hi> his greateſt Enemy,
<note place="margin">Tom. 1. p. 264. A.</note> that he did imbrace what there was of truth in the Writings of <hi>John Wickliff,</hi> Doctor in Divinity; not becauſe he ſaid it, but becauſe it was agreeable unto the Holy Scriptures, and unto Reaſon; but if he taught any Error, he intended not to follow him nor any one elſe therein. And in full Council,
<note place="margin">Ibid. fol. 13.</note> being charged with the 40 Articles of <hi>Wickliff,</hi> condemned by the Fathers of <hi>Conſtance,</hi> he ſaid, that he adhered not unto <hi>Wickliffs</hi> Errors; confeſſing nevertheleſs, that he could have wiſhed the Archbiſhop of <hi>Prague,</hi> had not condemned them after the manner that he had condemned them; declares,
<note place="margin">Ibid. fol. 13. B.</note> that he never obſtinately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended them, although he approved not that they ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, before that the Juſtice of their condemnation was ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reaſons taken from the Holy Scriptures; In fine, he defends himſelf particularly upon each of theſe Articles, limiting, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, or diſtinguiſhing them, without any heed being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto given by the Council; and what there is beſides very ſtrange in the buſineſs, that anſwering in his Writings unto the
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:47504:257"/>Objections of his Adverſaries, which had been before of his ſide, but were become his Enemies,
<note place="margin">Tom. 1. ſo. 255. &amp; 265. &amp; p. 292. unto fol. 321.</note> he never toucheth the Article of Tranſubſtantiation; yet it is not likely, that having been his Friends, they could be ignorant of his Opinion upon this weighty point, nor that they could have been ſilent, if <hi>John</hi>'s belief had been contrary unto that of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> beſides the intimate friendſhip which was betwixt him and <hi>John Hus,</hi> which continued until their Death, as it had been carefully improved in their life, eſpecially by the conformity of their Faith and Manners, there is to be ſeen in the ſame Works, a Diſcourſe, wherein the Author ſaith the ſame of <hi>Jerom,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tom. 2. ſo. 356.</note> which he had done of <hi>Hus;</hi> for he writes, that one of his Adverſaries having ſaid there was a report, <hi>That he believed that the ſubſtance of Bread remained upon the Altar, he made this anſwer, I believe the Bread is at the Bakers, and not in the Sacrament of the Altar.</hi>

Aretin. in faſcicul. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum expeton. &amp; fugiend. fol. 152.</note> Which agrees very well with what is written by <hi>Pogge</hi> the <hi>Florentine,</hi> unto his Friend <hi>Leonard Are<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin; Jerom</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>being examined what he believed touching the Sacrament, anſwered, That by Nature it was Bread, but at the inſtant of Conſecration and afterwards, it was the true Body of Jeſus Chriſt, that he believed it to be ſo, and all the reſt according as the Church believed.</hi> And ſome body having replyed, <hi>it is reported that thou teacheſt that the Bread remaineth after Conſecration;</hi> he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>the Bread remaineth at the Bakers houſe.</hi> This is the ſum of the belief of <hi>John Hus,</hi> and of <hi>Jerom</hi> of <hi>Prague</hi> touching the ſubject of the Sacrament. Nevertheleſs, the Council of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance</hi> cauſed them to be burnt alive; they endured this puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with wonderful patience, according to the relation of <hi>Pogge</hi> the <hi>Florentine,</hi> an Eye witneſs, and of <hi>Eneas Sylvius,</hi> which ſpeaks thus, <hi>They both dyed very contentedly, and drew near unto the Stake as cheerfully, as if they were going unto a Banquet, without letting fall a word as might expreſs any thing of grief or ſorrow; when the Flames began to ſeize them, they ſang a Hymn, the ſound whereof could ſcarce be ſtopped by the noiſe of the Fire.</hi> It is ſaid, <hi>That never any Philoſopher ſuffered Death ſo conſtantly as theſe Men endured the puniſhment of the Flames.</hi> The Death of theſe two Men ſerved only to confirm the <hi>Taborites</hi> in their Opinions, and inſpired them with Zeal for its defence, and of making pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick and open profeſſion thereof in <hi>Bohemia;</hi> not but there was found in other parts thoſe which profeſſed the ſame Doctrine; for <hi>Baleus</hi> reports upon the relation of <hi>Thomas Gaſconius,</hi> and of <hi>Leland,</hi> that in the year 1457. <hi>Reginald Peacock,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter</hi> in <hi>England, Had ill Opinions touching the Sacrament, and that he maintained the Doctrine of</hi> Wickliff;
<note place="margin">Centur. 8. Auth. 19.</note> but that he was
<pb n="509" facs="tcp:47504:257"/>compelled to renounce, and moreover was deprived of his Biſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oprick. It is very probable he had followers in his Dioceſs, yet they were cautious in declaring themſelves, for fear of being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled. It was otherwiſe in <hi>Bohemia,</hi> the profeſſion of this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine being more free, by reaſon of the great numbers of perſons which had embraced it, and which had ſeparated themſelves from the Communion of the Latin Church. If we credit Hiſtorians, King <hi>George Pogebrack,</hi> who in the Year 1455. ſucceeded <hi>Ladiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi> Son of <hi>Albert,</hi> became Protector of the <hi>Taborites;</hi> that he embraced this Party, and afterwards drew upon himſelf the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications of two Popes; <hi>Pius</hi> the Second, and <hi>Paul</hi> the Second. I will not here inſiſt upon the Commendations which ſome of theſe Hiſtorians give him for his Vertue, Juſtice, Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Integrity: neither do I intend to examine the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences which he had with theſe two Popes; againſt whoſe <hi>Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thema's</hi> he defended himſelf, as well as againſt the Enemies which he had engaged againſt him, unto his death, which happened in the Year 1471. I ſhall content my ſelf to obſerve, that the Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, which repreſent him unto us as a <hi>Taborite,</hi> and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor of the <hi>Taborites,</hi> are groſly miſtaken: which may warn us not too eaſily to give credit unto all that they report. In fine, we have a Letter of this Prince, unto <hi>Mathias,</hi> King of <hi>Hunga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> his Son in Law, dated in the Year 1468. which <hi>Dom Luke d'Achery,</hi> a Benedictine Friar, hath lately publiſhed; the reading whereof informs us ſeveral things. In the firſt place, that the Doctrine of the <hi>Taborites</hi> and <hi>Waldenſis</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> if it were ſo, that there were any of the ancient <hi>Waldenſis</hi> ſtill remaining,
<note place="margin">Tom 4. Spicil. p. 415.</note> was ſuch as we have repreſented. <hi>It muſt be granted</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>if we will ſay things that are more true than apparent, that ſeveral Errors have flouriſhed in this Kingdom touching the Sacrament of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt;</hi> Circa remanentem panis Sacramentalis (ſic enim illi nuncupabant) <hi>upon their teaching that the Bread of the Sacrament remained, and that it was converted into the ſubſtance of the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicant.</hi> In the ſecond place, that this Prince was not a <hi>Taborite,</hi> but a <hi>Calixtin;</hi> becauſe he deſired to communicate under both kinds, as he had always done, after the example of his Father, his Mother, and his Grandmother; but that in all other points, he was agreed with the Latin Church. Thirdly, It may be ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered from this Letter, that the <hi>Taborites,</hi> whoſe Doctrine he ſtyles to be erroneous, were not kindly uſed by this King:
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 415.</note> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Apology which they made in the Year 1508. under the name of <hi>Waldenſis,</hi> againſt the Doctor <hi>Auguſtin,</hi> they com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that ſome of their Brethren ſuffered great miſeries under King <hi>George Pogebrack,</hi> by reaſon of their Opinion touching the
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:47504:258"/>Article of the Sacrament. Unto <hi>George Pogebrack</hi> ſucceeded <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſlaus,</hi> Son of <hi>Caſimir,</hi> King of <hi>Poland;</hi> whom the <hi>Bohemians,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Ritius</hi>) choſe for their King,
<note place="margin">De regno Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar. l. 2.</note> upon condition that he would ſuffer the <hi>Huſſites</hi> (he makes them all one with the <hi>Taborites</hi>) to enjoy their Liberty of Conſcience; which he did until the latter end of this XV. Century. But at length, the malicious Accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of their Enemies having prevailed over the Spirit of <hi>Ladiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In faſciculo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum expeten. fol. 81. Dubrav. hiſt. Bohem. l. 32.</note> as appears by the firſt Letter they wrote unto this Prince, to inform him, that it was nothing but falſe calumnies, whereby they endeavoured to miſ-repreſent them unto him. They were forbidden all ſorts of Aſſemblies, both publick and private. They were commanded to ſhut up the places where they were wont to make their Aſſemblies; not to preach nor teach their Doctrine any more, neither by word, nor by writing; and in a certain time to conform themſelves, either unto the <hi>Calixtins,</hi> or unto the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Church. This Edict occaſioned two Letters which they wrote unto <hi>Lagiſlaus,</hi> with all the humility and reſpect as was due unto the Majeſty of their Prince and Soveraign; wherein they complained of ſo great ſeverity, and of condemning them before they were heard. And the more to excite him to have compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion on them, they joyned their Confeſſion of Faith unto each of theſe Letters; declaring what was their Belief of the Sacrament. In the firſt, written, <hi>Anno</hi> 1504. they ſay, <hi>That they believe that the Bread which Jeſus Chriſt took, which he bleſſed, broke, and the which he ſaid was his Body; that it is his Body:</hi> which they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain more particularly in the ſecond, which they wrote the year following: <hi>We believe and confeſs that the Bread is the natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Jeſus Chriſt, and the Wine his natural Blood, ſacramentally.</hi> And becauſe the Doctor <hi>Auguſtin</hi> charged them with having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed Tranſubſtantiation in their Writings, they do proteſt that they did not write ſo;
<note place="margin">Contr. binas litter. Doctor. Auguſtin, ann. 1508. in faſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culo ſupra no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minato.</note> 
                     <hi>For</hi> (ſay they) <hi>this Confeſſion hath no foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the words of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; which ſaid nothing of the Real Preſence, neither under theſe ſpecies, nor in this, nor of this, nor with this.</hi> Beſides, they reject the Adoration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; and there alſo they declare, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger perſonally upon Earth, and that they expect him not until the day of Judgment; giving no credit unto thoſe which ſhew his perſon here below.</hi> And a little after they declare, That Jeſus Chriſt promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his Diſciples to be with them ſpiritually, by the participation of his Body and Blood; and in the Sacrament, in vertue, with the teſtimony of his holineſs. Whereupon, they alledge the words of St. <hi>Auſtin; Donec ſeculum finiatur, ſurſum eſt Dominus, ſed tamen hic etiam nobiſcum eſt veritas Dominus, corpus enim in quo reſurrexit in uno loco eſſe oportet.</hi> And there alſo they deny that
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:47504:258"/>the Body of Jeſus Chriſt is in ſeveral places at once.
<note place="margin">In Prologom. de Vald. c. 8.</note> It would be difficult, and even impoſſible to declare what was the effect of theſe Apologies, ſeeing the Hiſtorians are therein ſilent. Only the Jeſuit <hi>Gretzer</hi> makes this Obſervation; <hi>The</hi> Waldenſis <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved themſelves a long time in</hi> Bohemia,
<note place="margin">Geſner. in Bib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liothec.</note> 
                     <hi>and to this day they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be quite rooted out.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was about the ſame time, that one <hi>Paulus Scriptoris,</hi> Profeſſor in Divinityin the Univerſity of <hi>Tubinge,</hi> was baniſhed, for having in his Lectures, ſpoken againſt the common Belief of the Euchariſt.</p>
                  <p>But this is not all yet; for the <hi>Waldenſis</hi> of <hi>Provens</hi> and <hi>Pied<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont</hi> preſent themſelves, and oblige us to ſpeak of them. As the Perſecutions were violent in <hi>France</hi> againſt thoſe people in the XII. and XIII. Centuries, and particularly in the latter, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Popes publiſhed ſeveral <hi>Croyſado's</hi> againſt them, they were, in fine conſtrained to diſperſe themſelves; and in this diſperſion, conſiderable numbers of them retired themſelves into <hi>Provens,</hi> and towards <hi>Labriers</hi> and <hi>Merindol,</hi> where they preſerved them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves until the Reign of <hi>Lewis</hi> the Twelfth; at which time they were perſecuted by the Friars and Inquiſitors, who brake in vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently upon them by force and Arms; ſaying, That they ſhould be exterminated like ſo many Witches and <hi>Sodomites;</hi> whereby they were neceſſitated to deſire the protection of this Prince; who, the better to be informed of the truth of matters,

                  </p>
                  <p>What I ſay of the <hi>Armenians,</hi> I may almoſt ſay of all the <hi>Greeks</hi> in general; for it cannot be denied but they be fallen into very great ignorance of the Myſteries of Chriſtian Religion, and have corrupted their primitive Faith by many Alterations. Neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, Learning having flouriſhed a long time amongſt them, their ignorance is not ſo very great, as that of other Chriſtian Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of the Eaſt. They have had but very few that have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſince the Ages which we have examined in the precedent Chapter: yet have they had ſome few; as <hi>Nicholas de Methona, Nicholas Cabaſilas, Mark</hi> of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> and <hi>Jeremy,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> As for <hi>Beſſarion,</hi> I do not put him into the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, becauſe he turned unto the party of the Latins; who, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quite him, honoured him with a Cardinals Cap; whereas the others died in the Communion of the Greek Church. If you would know of them what they believed of the Euchariſt, they will anſwer, <hi>That the Bread and Wine are changed into the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; and that after Conſecration, they are his Body Blood:</hi> And ſo far the Roman Catholicks have cauſe to believe they be of their ſide. But it muſt be confeſſed alſo, that they ſay things which do not agree well with the Hypotheſis of the Latins; and which make the Proteſtants conclude, that the change whereof they ſpeak, is not a change of ſubſtance, but of vertue and efficacy: for, not here to repeat what is ſaid by <hi>Euthymius</hi> in the foregoing Chapter,

                     <hi>Nicholas de Methona</hi> doth formally affirm the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Symbols unto the Divinity; which is exactly the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of <hi>Damaſcen;</hi> an Opinion which, as hath been ſhewed, doth preſuppoſe the Exiſtence of the Bread and Wine. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>doth this (that is to ſay, communicates unto us his Fleſh

<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Grace of the Holy Ghoſt doth ſpiritually ſanctifie our Souls, and our Bodies are ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by the ſenſible things; to wit, the Water, the Oyl, the Bread, the Wine, and the other things ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Which language agrees better with <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> whom he cites in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Anſwer, than with the Latins; becauſe the firſt preſerves the ſubſtance of Bread and Wine, but the latter quite deſtroys it.</p>
                  <p>The Cardinal of <hi>Guiſe</hi> being at <hi>Venice,</hi> had a Conference with the Greeks; and amongſt ſeveral Queſtions that he asked them, he demanded of them what they believed of the Sacrament:
<note place="margin">Cum Sigiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundo Libero de rebus Moſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covit.

But becauſe in this Anſwer they alledge as well the words of <hi>Theophelact</hi> upon <hi>Mar.</hi> 14. by which he declares, <hi>That the Bread and Wine is changed into the vertue of the Fleſh and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> as alſo ſeveral paſſages of <hi>Damaſcen,</hi> ſome of which have already been examined in the 12th Chapter, to ſtrengthen their Belief and Opinion; we are obliged to believe, that the change whereof they ſpeak is quite different from that of the Latin Church.</p>
                  <p>It is true that ſcarce any of them explained themſelves as fully as <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Lucar,</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> who a little above thirty years ago, ſaid,

                     <hi>We believe that the other Sacrament which our Lord did inſtitute, is that which we call Euchariſt; for the night wherein he was betrayed, taking Bread, and bleſſing it, he ſaid unto the Diſciples,</hi> Take, eat; this is my Body: <hi>And taking the Cup, he gave thanks, and ſaid,</hi> Drink ye all of this, it is my Blood which is ſhed for you; Do this in remembrance of me. <hi>And St.</hi> Paul <hi>adds,</hi> As often as ye eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup, ye ſhew the Lord's death. <hi>This is the plain, the true, and lawful Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition

I ſhould alſo mention the Voyage which he made unto <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> whilſt he was Patriarch of <hi>Alexandria;</hi> the good ſucceſs which he had there, of meeting his friend, <hi>Cornelius Haga,</hi> Ambaſſador from the States General of the United Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; the deſign then in hand of making him Patriarch, the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties which interpoſed therein, and his Return unto <hi>Alexandria,</hi> from whence he was again called, in the Year 1621. to be inſtal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this Dignity, unto the general ſatisfaction of the Greek Church. The great perſecutions and troubles which the Latins ſtirred up againſt him; and how, notwithſtanding all their Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and endeavours, he preſerved his Dignity of Patriarch of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> although with ſome difficulty, by reaſon of the malice of his Enemies, from the Year 1621. unto the Year 1638. at which time they got ſome opportunity to ſtrangle him: and ſeveral other notable circumſtances wherewith his life was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. But becauſe in this place I conſider him only as a Patriarch of the Greek Church, which ſpake of the Euchariſt in the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Faith which he compoſed, and communicated unto a Synodal Aſſembly, convocated at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in the Year 1629. although ſeveral years before he had made ſeveral acquainted with it, and had alſo left a Copy of it with the Biſhop of <hi>Leopolis;</hi> from whence it was ſent to <hi>Rome.</hi> I ſhall content my ſelf only in obſerving, that this Confeſſion of Faith found different Recepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The Proteſtants rejoyced, in as much as it is exactly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="517" facs="tcp:47504:261"/>unto their belief. The <hi>Armenians</hi> finding it contrary unto them in the point of Predeſtination, and of Free Will,; rejected it, as being forged by the Proteſtants: and there were ſome amongſt the Latins which did ſo too. But at laſt, all the World was diſabuſed, and every body was conſtrained to own, that it was truly made by the Patriarch. And how can it be queſtioned, after being refuted by <hi>Caryophylus,</hi> and two Councils, where it is ſaid it was condemned; the one under <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Beroe;</hi> who, by the violent death of the other <hi>Cyril,</hi> became the peaceable Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor of the Patriarchſhip; and who, in the Year 1639. aſſembled a Synod at <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> wherein he cauſed the Confeſſion now ſpoke of, to be condemned. And the other under <hi>Parthenius;</hi> who, having driven out <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Beroe,</hi> in the Year 1641. had it alſo condemned in 1642. As to the Refutation of <hi>Caryophylus,</hi> it cannot reaſonably be thought to contain the Opinions of the Greek Church; becauſe that although he was a Greek by Nation, yet he was a Latin by Religion;
<note place="margin">Programmate poſter.</note> having been bred up at <hi>Rome</hi> from his Infancy, as <hi>Nihuſius</hi> doth confeſs. And as for the two Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, if they be received to be Councils of the whole Greek Church, for legitimate Councils, where all things were done in due form; in a word, for true Councils, it muſt be granted, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Lucar,</hi> the ſame with that of the Proteſtants, had not time to be ſetled amongſt the Greeks; but the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants do not yield at the ſight of theſe two Councils, which they ſuppoſe to be only forged by the Latins. In fine, There was late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communicated unto me a Treatiſe of a learned Man of this Communion, which proves by many ſtrong Arguments and Reaſons, that theſe two Councils were only fained by the Latins; which I intend not to determine: but I ſhall only ſay, that there is one thing in this Hiſtory which much ſurpriſeth me, which is, that <hi>Parthenius,</hi> under whom the latter of theſe Councils was to have been aſſembled, in the Year 1642. was driven out by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Parthenius,</hi> unto whom <hi>Leo Allatius,</hi> a Greek, Latinized, and Library-keeper of the <hi>Vatican,</hi> gives this teſtimony,
<note place="margin">De perpet. conſenſ. Eccl. Orient. &amp; Occi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. l. 3. c. 11.</note> of having been Diſciple to <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Lucar,</hi> and a great favourer of the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viniſts:</hi> from whence they fail not to infer, that the Doctrine of <hi>Cyril</hi> was not extinguiſhed with his perſon; as neither do they ſpare to ſay, that if the Greek Church did believe the Doctrine of Tranſubſtantiation, there would ſigns of it appear in the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of their Councils, as well as in thoſe of the Latin Church; in their Liturgies, Catechiſms, and in the publick and authentical pieces touching their Religion; which yet they pretend is not to be ſeen. They add alſo, that the Greeks believe that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion breaks the Faſt; that the Euchariſt is digeſted, and goes
<pb n="518" facs="tcp:47504:262"/>into the draft, with other common meats, as hath been ſhewed in the 17th Chapter. They obſerve, that they receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſtanding; that they do not bow unto it when it is carried unto <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Therefore <hi>Arcudius,</hi> a Latinized Prieſt, of the Iſle of <hi>Corfu,</hi> all in a paſſion, demands of <hi>Gabriel</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> wherefore, the the Conſecration of the Gifts being ended, <hi>That the Prieſt doth not bow his head, nor adore, nor proſtrate himſelf, nor give any ſhew of honour? Wherefore is it that he doth not light Candle, nor ſing any Songs nor Hymns unto the Sacrament; making unto it neither reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, nor bowing of the head; nor of the knee, not honouring it by bowing down unto the ground; and not ſo much as ſaying unto it,</hi> Lord, remember me in thy Kingdom. Beſides, I think that the Greeks in general are at this time ſo ignorant, that they are not very capable of giving an account of their Faith, touching the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sacrament. So that, if I miſtake not, it would be no difficult matter for perſons any thing ingenious, whether Proteſtants or Roman Catholicks, to make them to embrace and believe either of the two Opinions.</p>

               <head>THE HISTORY OF THE EUCHARIST.</head>
               <head>Part III. Wherein is Treated of the Worſhip of it.</head>
               <p>AFter having ſeen and conſidered the manner how the Ancient Chriſtians did Celebrate their Euchariſt. and what they ſaid and believed of this Auguſt Sacrament, with all the Changes and Alterations which have thereupon en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued, and the many Diſputes and Conteſts which have frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hapned in <hi>Europe,</hi> from <hi>Paſchas</hi> until <hi>Berengarius;</hi> and from <hi>Berengarius,</hi> until the great ſeparation of the Proteſtants. The method propoſed by us, neceſſarily requires, that we ſhould employ this Third Part in examining the Worſhip, I mean, to conſider the diſpoſitions and preparations which ſhould go before the Celebration of the Sacrament, and of the inclinations and motions of the Soul of the Communicant, either towards God and Jeſus Chriſt, or in reſpect of the Sacrament it ſelf; that we ſhould examine the great queſtion of Latrie; and that we ſhould endeavour to diſcover what the Church hath from time to time required of thoſe which approach'd unto the holy Table, to participate of this adorable Myſtery of our Salvation. For it muſt not be imagined, that theſe firſt Chriſtians which aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with Zeal and Piety, contented themſelves in Celebrating
<pb n="520" facs="tcp:47504:263"/>this Divine Sacrament with indifferency, and meerly for faſhion ſake, and only to declare what they believed of the Nature of the Symbols, of their uſe and employment; and that they omitted the neceſſary preparations both for celebrating, and for worthily partaking thereof. In fine, the abode which I made in the Country of Eccleſiaſtical Antiquity; and the inſpection which for ſome years I made into the Records and Regiſters which contain the Laws and Cuſtoms of this great Empire, have informed me, that this great and ſublime Myſtery, is not Celebrated; and that none preſume to Communicate, without great preparation, devotion, and reſpect: And that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that Country made the actions of Jeſus Chriſt, (celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his Sacrament, and that of the Apoſtles in Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the model of their Celebration; whereunto, nevertheleſs, in proceſs of time, they added ſeveral Ceremonies which had not been uſed at firſt) and the words of this ſame Saviour, the foundation of their Doctrine, and of their Faith, upon this important Article of Religion. They had alſo conſidered the Commemoration that the Lord, and afterwards his Apoſtle, commands us to make of his Perſon and of his Death; and the proof and examination which this latter requires of us, as the fountain and principle of all the diſpoſitions neceſſary for Celebrating and for Conimunicating. Having therefore treated at large of the two firſt Heads, we are indiſpenſibly obliged to treat of the third point, thereby to finiſh and compleat this Hiſtory: And becauſe the Celebration precedes the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and that the actions of him that Celebrates, goes before them of the Communicant, we will firſt treat of the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions incumbent upon him which doth Celebrate the Holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>

                     <p>Of the Preparations which precede the Celebration.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WHen Jeſus Chriſt did Celebrate his Euchariſt, the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts do not mention that he prepared himſelf by any Ceremony; they only declare, That after the Supper of the Paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over was ended, he took Bread, and that having prayed unto his Father over this Bread, he broke it, and diſtributed it unto his Diſciples. I only ſay, that at the very inſtant, there is no queſtion to be made, but that he lifted up his Soul unto his Father, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech him that he would make this Sacrament which he went about to Inſtitute for a Seal of his Covenant, ſaving and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious unto his Children, unto the end of the World: And that taking the Bread to make it a ſign of his Body, he did it with that reverence, which of it ſelf ſhewed, that he went about do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething that was of great weight and moment. The Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, nor St. <hi>Paul,</hi> make no mention at all of any preparation accompanied with many external Ceremonies; our Saviour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to inſtitute this Myſtery with much plainneſs and ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, agreeable unto the Nature of the Goſpel; the Worſhip whereof was to be wholly Spiritual and Divine, according unto what Jeſus Chriſt ſaid unto the woman of <hi>Samaria, That God is a Spirit, and he muſt be worſhipped by them which ſerve him, in ſpirit and in truth.</hi> About ſix or ſeven ſcore years after, the Conductors of the Chriſtian Churches uſed no other Ceremony in the Celebration of the holy Sacrament; for St. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">St. Juſtin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr. Apol. 2.</note> who gives an ample deſcription of the exteriour form of Cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brating the Sacrament, which was obſerved in his time, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes no other preparation unto us on behalf of the Paſtor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Sacrament, but only that when the Sermon made unto the People, was ended, reading ſome portion of the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, he made a prayer unto God; and that when prayer was finiſhed, the Believers having ſaluted each other with the kiſs of Charity, there was preſented unto him Bread, Wine and Water, over which things, he prayed unto God to Conſecrate them; and the People having anſwered <hi>Amen,</hi> the diſtribution was made unto the Communicants by the Miniſtry of the Deacons.</p>
                  <p>Nothing can be ſeen more ſimple, nor more agreeable unto the Inſtitution of this Sacrament, then the manner that was uſed in Celebrating of it in the days of St. <hi>Juſtin,</hi> ſeeing there is no mention made of any preparation made by him that Celebrates,
<pb n="522" facs="tcp:47504:264"/>in order unto this holy Action, being content to prepare and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf thereunto in private, by ardent and zealous prayers unto God, that he would be pleaſed to enable him by his Grace to Celebrate this Venerable Sacrament, with the Gravity, Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, and Devotion, befitting ſo illuſtrious a Monument of his great kindneſs and love: But this great ſimplicity was not to the liking of thoſe which came after; They thought God was to be ſerved with more pomp; and that the ſplendor of outward Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies, would advance the Dignity of the Myſteries of his Religion. It often happens, that we think God is like our own ſelves; and that becauſe we naturally love outward pomp, and are exceedingly inclined unto Pageantries, we fondly conceit that it is the ſame with the Almighty; and that the Service which we addreſs unto him, would be much more acceptable for being beautified and enriched with a great many Ceremonies, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with many myſtical actions, into which deep ſearch muſt be made, to underſtand their ſenſe and meaning. This is indeed the Spring and Original cauſe of all thoſe which in proceſs of time have been introduced by Men in the Celebration of the Sacrament of the Euchariſt: But becauſe we here only enquire into thoſe which Celebrate, and of the preparations which they ought to make for this holy Action, we muſt, to proſecute our deſign, conſider what is hapned in this preparation ſince <hi>Juſtin Martyr.</hi> In the Conſtitutions which go in the Apoſtles names, there is a Liturgy for the Celebration of the Euchariſt; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, after Prayers unto God for the Catechumeny, the Energu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meny, and the Penitents; for thoſe which are ready to receive Baptiſm, and for the faithful. And after having diſmiſſed all thoſe which by the Laws of the Church could not be preſent at the Celebration of Divine Myſteries, the Deacons did preſent upon the Altar,
<note place="margin">Conſtit. Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtol. l. 8. c. 12.</note> the Oblations unto the Biſhop, having a Prieſt on each hand of him, and a Deacon at each end of the Altar, with Fanns, to hinder any Fly, or other little Creature, from fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the Cup: Then the Biſhop, with the Prieſts, pray unto God with a low voice; then he puts on a rich Veſtment, and ſtanding by the Altar, he makes the Sign of the Croſs, and ſaith unto the People there preſent, <hi>The Grace of God Almighty, the Love of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Communication of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit, be with you all;</hi> and thoſe which be preſent anſwer with one accord, <hi>And with thy Spirit.</hi> The Biſhop ſaith again, <hi>Lift up your hearts;</hi> unto which the People reply, <hi>We do unto the Lord;</hi> and the Biſhop, <hi>Let us give thanks unto the Lord; It is juſt and right,</hi> ſay the People. After which, the Biſhop addreſſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto God, ſaith, <hi>That it is juſt and right to praiſe him;</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="523" facs="tcp:47504:264"/>in a long Diſcourſe, the motives and reaſons of this praiſe, taken either from the Nature of God and his works, whether of the Creation and Preſervation of his ancient People, or from the redemption and ſending Jeſus Chriſt into the World for our Salvation; which diſcourſe he concludeth by the Hiſtory of the Inſtitution of the Sacrament; from whence he proceedeth unto the Conſecration after the manner of the Greeks. And this is in ſhort the ſubſtance of the preparations which this Liturgy doth propoſe unto us on the part of him which doth Celebrate.
<note place="margin">Dionyſ. Arco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pag. de Eccleſ. Hierarch. c. 3.</note> In that of the pretended <hi>Dennis</hi> the <hi>Arcopagite,</hi> the Biſhop makes his prayer near the Altar, cauſeth Incence to be burnt, and goeth round the place of the Aſſembly; returning unto the Altar, he beginneth to ſing Pſalms, all the Clergy ſinging with him. After which the Deacon readeth ſome part of the holy Scriptures; which being ended, the Catechumeny, the Energumeny, and the Penitents, are made to go out: Then the chief amongſt the Deacons, together with the Prieſts, put the Bread and Cup of bleſſing upon the Altar. After a general Hymnologie of all the Church, the Biſhop prayeth, gives the bleſſing unto thoſe which are preſent, which ſalute each other; and having with the Prieſts, waſhed his hands, he Conſecrates the Divine gifts. But becauſe one of the circumſtances of this preparation, is the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Incenſe, let us endeavour to diſcover as near as may be, the time when Chriſtians firſt began to introduce this Ceremony into the ſervice of their holy Religion. <hi>Tertullian,</hi> who wrote at the end of the ſecond Century, and the beginning of the third, doth ſufficiently teſtifie, that Chriſtians, in that time, were wholly ignorant of the uſe of it, and that perfumes were not uſed in their Worſhip; for ſpeaking of prayers, which they preſented unto God for their Emperors;

But if we ſhould take what he ſaith in a literal ſenſe, I do not ſuppoſe there could any great ſtreſs be laid upon it; And to ſpeak the truth, there are ſo many things in this ſmall Treatiſe which are ſo unworthy of the true St. <hi>Hypollitus,</hi> that I ſhould be very loth to attribute them unto him. St. <hi>Jerom,</hi> its true, reckons amongſt his Works, a Treatiſe of Antichriſt; but it is evident it cannot be the ſame which is now extant; for it is entituled, <hi>A Prayer of St.</hi> Hypolitus, <hi>Biſhop and Martyr; of the End of the World, of Antichriſt, and of the ſecond coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Moreover the ſame S. <hi>Jerom,</hi> in his Catalogue of Eccleſiaſtical Writers, obſerves, That he had made a Sermon in the praiſe of Jeſus Chriſt; and that the Author ſaith in this Sermon, That he repeated it in the preſence of <hi>Origen.</hi> Now it is moſt certain, that in <hi>Origen</hi>'s time the Greeks knew not what Perfumes and Incenſe meant in their Worſhip; for Expounding theſe words of <hi>Levit.</hi> 24. <hi>Thou ſhalt put pure Incenſe upon each Row,</hi> (that is to ſay, of the Shew-bread) he ſpeaks in ſuch a manner as ſufficiently ſheweth, that Chriſtians had not then admitted the uſe of Incenſe into their Worſhip,
<note place="margin">Hom. 13. in Levit. c. 24. tom. 1. p. 106. I.</note> 
                     <hi>Do not imagine</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that Almighty God hath commanded nor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his Law, to bring him Incenſe from</hi> Arabia; <hi>but this is the Incenſe which he requires Men ſhould offer unto him, and wherein he findeth a ſweet ſmell and ſavour,</hi> to wit, <hi>Prayers proceeding from

                  </p>
                  <p>I allow that <hi>Origen</hi> here departs a little from the literal ſenſe, in reſpect of the Law; but his language doth clearly evidence, that Incenſe and Perfumes were not then received into the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Eaſtern Chriſtians. Let us then own, that this uſe was introduced into the Greek Church after <hi>Origen</hi>'s days, who departed this life towards the latter end of the third Century; and by conſequence, the Canons; which falſly bear the Apoſtles names, have been made ſince that time; ſeeing therein it is or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained to offer Perfumes for the Celebration of the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe it appears by the prayer of the Emperor <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine,</hi> at the Aſſembly of the Saints, or in the Church of God, whoſe words have been already alledged, that even the Eaſtern Chriſtians did not uſe Perfume in the Celebration of their Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, for the greateſt part of the IV. Century; at leaſt, when they celebrated it at the Tombs of Martyrs; I cannot tell but it ought to be granted, that the fourth pretended Canon of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles was made ſince <hi>Conſtantine</hi>'s time, who departed this life in the year of our Lord,
<note place="margin">Canon Apoſt. 4.</note> 337. for ſee here what it enjoyns: <hi>That no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe ſhould be offered at the Altar but of the firſt Ears of Corn, Grapes, Oyl for the Lights, and Incenſe for the time of the holy Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> And as it is the firſt teſtimony of the Greek Fathers, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in there is mention made of Perfume in the celebration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, that of <hi>Hypollitus</hi> not being to be credited; and being, moreover, capable of being conveniently interpreted of an Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorical Perfume, it muſt be granted, that the Latins received the uſe of Perfumes later into their Worſhip than the Greeks, ſeeing St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> doth not make any mention of it in the V. Century; for I take little heed of the ſecond Decretal of <hi>Soter,</hi> wherein Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are forbidden to bring any Perfume unto the Altar; becauſe this Decretal, and all them of the other Popes, until <hi>Siritius,</hi> are the Works of an Impoſtor.</p>
                  <p>When I ſay, that the Latins have received the practiſe of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe and Perfume later than the Greeks, I conclude that theſe latter followed the Ordinance of the pretended Canon of the Apoſtles; which, in all appearance, was not made, but very for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the IV. Century. And nevertheleſs, it is not certain, that the Greek Church put this Ordinance in execution preſently after it was made.

But for as much as the Learned, as well Roman Catholicks as Proteſtants, do confeſs, that either they were not the Works of theſe Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God; or if they be, that they have received many Alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, and that things have been foiſted into them, unknown unto the firſt Chriſtians; nothing hinders but we may in this num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber include the uſe of Incenſe; there being no likelihood that it would have been ſo late received into the Church, if it had been practiſed by an Apoſtle, and an Evangeliſt.</p>
                  <p>What I ſay of the Liturgies of St. <hi>James</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> I ſay alſo of that attributed unto St. <hi>Peter;</hi> wherein we obſerve the ſame thing. Which example the Chriſtians would not have fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have obſerved, had all the Liturgies appeared from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning.</p>
                  <p>As for the Liturgies of St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> and St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> I would not ſo poſitively affirm, that what is therein mentioned of the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Perfume hath been therein inſerted ſince the death of the Authors; for although that ſeveral things have been thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to annexed, and many things altered, and that there be ſeveral which even believe, that which goes under St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi>'s name, is not his; but of a more recent Author. Nevertheleſs the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the Apoſtles, which preſcribes the uſe of Incenſe in the celebration of the Sacrament, having been compoſed before ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe two Doctors of the Church, I ſhall refer it unto others to decide this difficulty, although St. <hi>Baſil,</hi> upon <hi>Pſal.</hi> 115. rejects the Oblation of Incenſe; and I ſhall content my ſelf in
<pb n="528" facs="tcp:47504:267"/>ſaying, that if theſe two Liturgies are truly St. <hi>Baſil</hi>'s and St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom</hi>'s, and if what is therein ſaid of the Oblation of perfume, hath not been thereunto added ſince their death, there is great cauſe to wonder that there is no mention at all made of it any where elſe, in the Works of Authors of the times before the Council of <hi>Chalcedon;</hi> at leaſt, I have not obſerved any, even in St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Myſtag. 5.</note> who deſcribing particularly enough the form of the celebration of the Sacrament, and the diſpoſitions thereunto requiſite, ſpeaketh not a word of the Oblation of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe. He ſaith indeed, that a Deacon giveth Water to waſh his hands that officiated, and unto the Prieſts that be with him; that the people are exhorted to give each other the Kiſs of Charity, to lift up their hearts on high, to give thanks unto the Lord; that there is mention made of Heaven and Earth, of the Sea, the Sun, Moon and Stars; and generally, of all Creatures, as well reaſonable Creatures as Brutes, of viſible and inviſible, of Angels and Arch-Angels, of Vertues, Dominions, Principalities, Powers, Thrones, and Cherubims which cover their faces; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe which were ſeen by the Prophet <hi>Eſay;</hi> and which cried one to another, ſaying, <hi>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> And after being ſo ſanctified, they pray unto God, that he will be pleaſed to ſend his Holy Spirit upon the Gifts propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, that is to ſay, the Bread and Wine; the Conſecration where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, the Greeks make to depend upon this Prayer: but as for the Ceremony of Incenſe, which we enquire after, the leaſt ſign of it is not to be found in the whole Catechiſm. As for the pretended <hi>Denis</hi> the <hi>Arcopagite,</hi> which gave occaſion unto this whole Enquiry; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan not to appear, at ſooneſt, until the end of the V. Century, or the beginning of the VI. at which time, the Perfumes and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſes were practiſed in the Service of the Greek Church.
<note place="margin">Tom. 6. Bibl. Pat.</note> I know very well, that in the Liturgy which goes under the name of St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> in the Library of the Fathers, there is Prayers made for thoſe which furniſhed the Oblations and Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices; the Bread, Wine, Oyl and Incenſe, and the Veſſels uſed at the Altar. So that if it were truly his, the introduction of this practice amongſt the Greeks ſhould be before the Council of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> becauſe <hi>Cyril</hi> was deceaſed before the Council was convo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated. But it being very uncertain whether it were <hi>Cyril</hi>'s, or whether he was the Author of it, or that it hath retained its puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, we have not ill aſſigned unto the Council of <hi>Chalcedon</hi> the firſt reſtimony of this cuſtom amongſt the Greeks, after the Ordinance of the Canon of the Apoſtles. 'Tis true, the Requeſt of <hi>Iſchyrion</hi> Deacon of the Church of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> wherein it is ſpoken of, and which is contained in the third Action of this Council; ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="529" facs="tcp:47504:267"/>to preſuppoſe the eſtabliſhment of this uſe, but of no long time, it may without any inconvenience be ſaid, that it began to be practiſed about the time of the aſſembling of this Council; and probably at <hi>Alexandria,</hi> rather than elſewhere,
<note place="margin">Concil. Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced. Act 3. t. 3. Concil. p. 247. ult. edit.</note> according to the Teſtament of a certain Lady, called <hi>Periſterie;</hi> who at her death, bequeathed great treaſures unto the Church, unto Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, Hoſpitals, and unto the Poor of the whole Province; and alſo proviſion to ſupply the Oblation of Perfume; as may be gathered from this Requeſt, as alſo from the time of the death of this Lady, which was whilſt <hi>Dioſcorus</hi> was Biſhop; and after the death of <hi>Cyril.</hi> But in as much as this cuſtom of offering In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe unto God at the time of celebrating the Euchariſt began to be introduced into the Eaſtern Church in the V. Century, as near as I can judge, the Reader will not be offended that I here repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent the Prayer which was made unto God, in preſenting him the Perfume: for although it be expreſſed in divers terms, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the diverſity of Liturgies; nevertheleſs, becauſe all theſe Prayers amount in ſubſtance unto the ſame thing, this here will be ſufficient. It is in the Liturgy of St. <hi>James;</hi> I mean,
<note place="margin">Liturgia S. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobi.</note> in that which goes under his name; <hi>O Lord Jeſus Chriſt, Word of God, who offeredſt thy ſelf upon the Croſs, as a holy Sacrifice unto thy God, thy Father, and thy King; which art that Coal of two natures, which didſt touch with Tongs the lips of the Prophet, and didſt cleanſe him from his iniquities; touch alſo our Underſtanding: Ours, I ſay, who are ſinners, and purifie us from all uncleanneſs: and grant, we may preſent our ſelves pure and holy at thine Altar, to offer unto thee a Sacrifice of Praiſe: And receive of us, who are unprofitable Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, this preſent Perfume, in an Odour of a ſweet ſavour. Change the ill ſavour of our Souls and Bodies into a ſweet Odour, and ſanctifie us by the ſanctifying vertue of thy Holy Spirit; for thou art the only Saint which ſanctifieth, and communicateſt thy ſelf unto the faithful. And unto whom, with thy Father, and thy good, holy and quickning Spirit, appertains the Glory, both now, and for ever,</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>As for what regards the Latin Church, it is no leſs difficult, preciſely to determine the time when Perfume was firſt offered in the Celebration of the Sacrament. It may very well be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred from what hath been alledged of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> that this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice was not received in his days in the Weſt; at leaſt, in the Church of <hi>Africa;</hi> I ſay, not in the Church of <hi>Africa:</hi> for I find in the Life of <hi>Boniface</hi> the firſt, Contemporary with St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> this Ordinance; <hi>That no Woman, or Nun,
<note place="margin">In lib. Pontific. t 1. Concil. p. 884.</note> ſhould touch nor waſh the ſacred Corporal, nor cauſe to be burnt any Incenſe in the Church, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the Deacons only.</hi> I know, the Pontifical Book, from whence this Life is taken, is a Book upon which no ſolid foundation can
<pb n="530" facs="tcp:47504:268"/>be laid: thoſe which have any knowledge of Eccleſiaſtical Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, make no eſteem of it. And the Impoſtor that forged the Decretals of the firſt Popes, hath made <hi>Soter</hi> to make a Decrete in the II. Century, like unto that of <hi>Boniface</hi> in the V. but for all that, I would not ſo abſolutely deny the truth of the Ordinance of <hi>Boniface,</hi> as I would that of <hi>Soter;</hi> for although the Pontifical Book is not always to be believed, nevertheleſs, it cannot be ſaid as poſitively, as of the Decretal of <hi>Soter,</hi> that it is forged. There is but one thing that ſticks with me, and is the reaſon that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give credit to the Decrete which is to be ſeen in the Life of <hi>Boniface:</hi> It is, that in all the Books of Sacraments of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt, nor in thoſe of Eccleſiaſtical Offices of St. <hi>Iſidore,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Sevil,</hi> there is no mention at all made, to the beſt of my remembrance, touching the Oblation of Perfume. It is not ſo of the Book called <hi>The Roman Order,</hi> wherein there is expreſs mention made of it; as alſo in <hi>Amalarius Fortunatus,</hi> who lived in the IX. Century: but as for the <hi>Roman Order,</hi> all are not agreed of its age; moſt thinking it was written towards the end of the VIII. Century, and ſome, in the XI. After all, in admitting the Decrete of Pope <hi>Boniface</hi> the Firſt, it will follow, that the uſe of Perfume and Incenſe in the Worſhip and Service of Religion, was not received by the Latins before the V. Century, if it be certain that it was then it ſelf received.</p>
                  <p>In a Book which treateth of Divine Offices, which <hi>Melchior Hiſtorpius</hi> cauſed to be printed, together with the <hi>Roman Order,</hi> there is ſeveral Prayers for conſecrating and bleſſing the Cenſer and the Incenſe; of each it will ſuffice to relate one. I ſay, in the firſt place, for the Cenſer; in bleſſing whereof, this Prayer is made unto God.
<note place="margin">Tom. 10. Bibl. Pat.</note> 
                     <hi>O Lord God, who, at the time that the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of</hi> Iſrael <hi>were devoured by fire, by reaſon of their Rebellion, thou wert pleaſed to hear the prayers of thy High Prieſt</hi> Aaron, <hi>ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing betwixt the Dead and the Living, and offering thee Incenſe, and ſaving the people out of the midſt of the fire; bleſs, we pray thee, this Cenſer: and grant, that as often as we therein offer Incenſe unto thee, we may become a Temple of a ſweet ſavour, acceptable unto thy Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And for the Perfume and Incenſe;
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>O Almighty Lord; God of</hi> Abraham, <hi>of</hi> Iſaac, <hi>and of</hi> Jacob; <hi>ſend upon this Creature of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume, and of Incenſe, the ſtrength and vertue of thy ſavour; to the end it may ſerve for a protection and defence unto thy Servants, to hinder the Enemy from entring into their hearts, and there fix his abode and reſidence; through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord,</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>And in the Pontifical;
<note place="margin">Pontific. Rom. par. 2. fol. 136. 2 Veniſe 1582.</note> 
                     <hi>O Lord God Almighty, in whoſe preſence doth ſtand with trembling, the Army of holy Angels; whoſe ſervice is wholly ſpiritual, and full of zeal; be pleaſed to behold, bleſs, and
<pb n="531" facs="tcp:47504:268"/>ſanctifie this Incenſe and Perfume, to the end that all the failures, the infirmities, and all the ſtratagems of the Enemy, ſmelling its ſavour, may fly away, and depart from thy Creatures, which thou haſt ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomed with the precious Blood of thy Son, never to be wounded by the biting of the wicked Serpent; through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> Amen.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe that which is called the Apoſtles fourth Canon joyns unto Incenſe, the Oyl for the Lights or Lamps, at the time of celebrating the Sacrament, it will not be amiſs to enquire into the firſt Original of this Cuſtom, as we have done into that of Incenſe. To this purpoſe the Reader need not expect that we ſhould treat of the primitive Chriſtians making uſe of Lamps and Candles in their Aſſemblies, becauſe every body knows they did not uſe them for Ceremony, but through pure neceſſity; being forced to aſſemble in the night, and early, before day-light, for fear of Perſecution. From thence did proceed the unjuſt ſlanders wherewith they were charged in <hi>Minucius Foelix,</hi> of cauſing the Lights to be extinguiſhed, the more greedily to ſatisfie their Luſts, and ſenſual Appetites. Neither will I ſpeak of the Wax Candles and <hi>Flambeaus</hi> which were uſed on <hi>Eaſter Eve;</hi> nor ſtand to ſhew when their uſe began, not only on this occaſion, but alſo in Feaſts and Funerals, as well as unto the honour of Images. Theſe things may probably be anſwered at ſome more convenient time: for the preſent, we muſt limit our ſelves within the matter which concerns the Sacrament, whereof we write the Hiſtory; and by conſequence, only conſider the uſe of the light of Lamps and Candles in that which relates unto the Worſhip and Service of God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tertullian</hi> accounted it as a great Superſtition in the Gentiles, for uſing Candles and Flambeaus in the day time; and ſaith, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians do not ſo;

But elſewhere he ſpeaketh in a manner which giveth plainly to underſtand, that the Chriſtians of his time did not at all admit, for Ceremony, the uſe of Candles, Flambeaus, or other Lights, in the Worſhip of their Religion: ſo that if they made uſe of any, it was only du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring their Nocturnal Aſſemblies; their Enemies not ſuffering them to meet together in the day time. <hi>Let them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day light Flambeaus</hi> (he ſpeaks of what was done in the Temples of Idols) <hi>which are abſolutely in darkneſs.

He would have ſpoke in another manner; and would have reſted ſatisfied to have ſhewn, that if Chriſtians admitted of this cuſtom amongſt the Ceremonies of their Religion, it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Honour and Glory of the true God; whereas Pagans did it unto unto the honour of their Idols, and their falſe Divinities. And writing unto his Wife,

                     <hi>She will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be incommoded with the ſmell of Incenſe at all the Solemnities of the Emperors, at the beginning of every new Year, and of each Month.

Thoſe which obey not this Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, ſhall be ſuſpended from the Communion of the Church.</hi> In the other, this may be ſeen; <hi>We have thought good that thoſe which are troubled with unclean Spirits ſhould be baptized: if they are Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, and in danger of death, let the Sacrament be given unto them; forbidding them to light Candles publickly. And if they do it contrary to this Prohibition, let them be deprived of the Communion.</hi> But this Council being aſſembled in a time when the Perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons againſt the Chriſtians were not wholly ceaſed, let us examine if, after the Empire was fallen into the hands of Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, in the perſon of <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great, whether the Church acted otherwiſe than it had done before.</p>

Vigilant. c. 3.</note> Prieſt of <hi>Barcelona,</hi> who approved not this Cuſtom, he ſaith amongſt other things, <hi>We do not light Flambeaus at Noon-day, as you do maliciouſly accuſe us, but it is only done by this means to ſupply the darkneſs of the Night, and to watch by the aſſiſtance and favour of the Light, to the end we ſhould not ſleep with you, in darkneſs; but if any do it for the honour of the Martyrs, by reaſon of the ignorance and ſimplicity of Lay perſons, or indeed of ſome devout women, of whom it may truly be ſaid, I confeſs they have a Zeal for God, but not according to knowledge; what prejudice is all this unto you:</hi> And becauſe <hi>Vigilantius</hi> charged ſuch People with Idolatry, St. <hi>Jerom</hi> to excuſe them, ſheweth, that there was a great deal of difference betwixt what the Pagans did, and what was practis'd by theſe Chriſtians;
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> 
                     <hi>That</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>was done unto Idols, therefore it ought to be had in deteſtation; but this is done unto Martyrs, therefore it may be allowed; for in all the Eaſtern Churches, beſides the relicks of Martyrs, when the Goſpel is to be read, Lights are ſet up in day time, not to diſſipate darkneſs, but for an expreſſion and ſign of joy.</hi> It muſt then be granted, that the practice of Lights and Flambeaus began not to be introduced into the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Chriſtians, until the V. Century; and not then neither into the whole Church univerſally, but only in the Eaſtern Churches, when they went about reading the Goſpel; which ſome did for the honour of Martyrs, being the effect of an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="535" facs="tcp:47504:270"/>Devotion, and deſtitute of true knowledge, according to the Opinion of St. <hi>Jerom;</hi> and the Exhortation directed by St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> unto his Auditors, in the place aboveſaid, of croſſing the Sea with Flambeaus, to go to the Sepulchre of the Martyr <hi>Phocas,</hi> tending only to expreſs their holy joy, for the advantage they had of poſſeſſing the Relicts of this Martyr, which had been Tranſported from <hi>Synopius</hi> unto <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> But after all, it appears by St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s Diſcourſe, that thoſe of the Weſt had not yet admitted of this Ceremony; and that it was not practiced neither in the Eaſtern Church, but at the time of reading the Goſpel. <hi>Eraſmus</hi> makes this Annotation upon the paſſage of St. <hi>Jerom, It ſeems St.</hi> Jerom <hi>believed it was a Superſtitious thing to light Flambeaus to the honour of Saints; and that none ſhould be uſed but for the convenience of ſuch as were to be employed in the Night ſeaſon; whereas at this time, the principal part of Worſhip is made to conſiſt in the Lights: But it appears, this Cuſtom was tolerated in that Age, rather than approved. Time changeth many things.</hi> In fine, we do not find any mention of it in the Liturgies which go under the names of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> nor even in that attributed unto St. <hi>Baſil;</hi> but only in that of St. <hi>Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom,</hi> that is to ſay, in that commonly attributed unto him, but which cannot be his, but of ſome Author much later than that Golden Tongue of the Ancient Church; or, if referring it unto St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> it may not truly be ſaid, That it hath received great changes and alterations: In the number of which, may well be put the place where there is mention made of Candles and Flambeaus; which yet I will not poſitively affirm, being very probable this Cuſtom was introduced by degrees into the Church, after St. <hi>Jerom</hi>'s time,

It's true, that his limiting this practice unto the Eaſtern Churches, imports, that the Churches of the Weſt did not yet obſerve it.

<note place="margin">Lib. 7.

<pb n="537" facs="tcp:47504:271"/>our joy, thereby to declare under the Type of a corporal Light, that Light ſpoken of in the Goſpel, That</hi> he is the true Light, which enlighteneth every man which cometh into the World. Since which time, moſt of thoſe which have treated of Divine Offices, have not failed to ſpeak of it, and therein to ſeek, as well as in all other things, ſome myſtical ſignification; ſo that it would be but loſt labour, any farther to follow the traces of this Ceremony, which was even at that time generally received amongſt the Greeks and the Latins, in the Eaſt and in the Weſt. Therefore may be ſeen in the <hi>Roman</hi> Order, and elſewhere, ſeveral prayers for bleſſing of Torches, Candles and Flambeaus, which are not neceſſary here to be inſerted: One ſhall ſuffice for all;
<note place="margin">Ordo Roman. t. 10. Bibl. Patr. p. 24.</note> 
                     <hi>O Lord Jeſus Chriſt, bleſs this Wax we beſeech thee; and therein pour by the vertue of thy heavenly Croſs, a heavenly Benediction: to the end, that by the Sign of the Croſs, it might receive of thee, who haſt gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven it unto men to ſcatter the darkneſs of the Night, ſuch a force and benediction, that in all places where it ſhall be lighted, or ſet, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſhould avoid, tremble, and fly for fear, with all his Imps, from thoſe places and habitations; and that he may no more attempt to moleſt and ſeduce thoſe that ſerve thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But having diſcourſed of the uſe of Lamps, Candles, and of Incenſe; the Author of Conſtitutions called Apoſtolical, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligeth us to ſpeak ſomewhat of the Sign of the Croſs, becauſe in his Liturgy of the Euchariſt, he repreſents the Biſhop making of it, when he addreſſeth himſelf unto the celebration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is moſt certain, that the Ancient Chriſtians often made the ſign of the Croſs, at leaſt ſince the end of the II. Century, as <hi>Tertullian</hi> informs us; but before him, I do not remember to have obſerved it: a practice thoſe Chriſtians oppoſed unto the reproach which the <hi>Gentiles</hi> made them of believing in a Man that had been put to death upon a Croſs; ſo that by this ſign, they would manifeſt unto their Enemies, that they were not aſhamed of their crucified Jeſus: So it is that St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> explains him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, when he ſaid, <hi>If after being crucified and buried,
<note place="margin">Catech. 4.</note> he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in the Grave, then we ſhould have cauſe to be aſhamed: but he is riſen, and aſcended up into Heaven.</hi> And elſewhere,
<note place="margin">Id. Catech. 13</note> 
                     <hi>Arm your ſelves againſt the enemies of this Croſs; plant for a Trophy againſt all oppoſers, the Faith of the Croſs: And when you engage in diſputing with Unbelievers touching the Croſs of our Saviour, firſt of all make the ſign of the Croſs, and you will put to ſilence your gainſayers: Be not aſhamed to confeſs the Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>of him that was crucified.</hi> But how frequent ſoever the Sign of the Croſs was amongſt Chriſtians, I cannot find, that during the three firſt Centuries, they commonly uſed it in the publick Service of
<pb n="538" facs="tcp:47504:272"/>Religion; and as I only treat at this time of the Sacrament, I ſhall only ſay, that the firſt places wherein there is any mention of the Sign of the Croſs in the celebration of this Divine Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, are the Liturgies of the Apoſtolick Conſtitutions, as hath been declared in this Chapter: And this Treatiſe could not have been written, but at the beginning of the IV. Century; thoſe attributed unto St. <hi>Peter, St. James,</hi> and <hi>St. Mark,</hi> are not as I conceive, any Elder, having many things in them unknown unto the firſt Chriſtians. As for the Liturgy of <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the II. Century, there is not one word mentioned of it, but what I dare not aſſure of the Sign of the Croſs, to wit, that it doth not appear in the celebration of the Sacrament during the three firſt Centuries, I ſhall not fear to affirm of the uſe of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial Croſſes, becauſe there were not yet any uſed in the Church; therefore <hi>Tertullian</hi> reckons expreſly amongſt falſe Opinions,
<note place="margin">Apolog. c. 15. &amp; 16.</note> that ſome Pagans entertained of the object of the Adoration of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians,
<note place="margin">Minut. in Octav.</note> the fancy of thoſe which thought, <hi>That they were Worſhippers, or Admirers of the Croſs;</hi> and in <hi>Minutius Felix, Cecilius</hi> in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective againſt Chriſtians, having ſaid, <hi>That ſome perſons eſteemed that the curſed Wood of the Croſs, was part of their Ceremonies. Octavius,</hi> that excellent defender of Chriſtianity, anſwereth, <hi>As for Croſſes, we neither care for them, nor Worſhip them.</hi> And it is very probable that Chriſtians began not to uſe Croſſes, until after it was believed, that <hi>Hellen</hi> Mother of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> had found the true Croſs of Jeſus Chriſt, in the year 326. But if we yet draw nearer unto the Sacrament, we ſhall not find any Croſs therein uſed, during all the time which hath been ſpoken of, nor yet later; for it doth not appear, neither in the Liturgy of <hi>St. Juſtin Martyr,</hi> nor in thoſe which go under the names of <hi>St. James, St. Peter,</hi> and of <hi>St. Mark:</hi> Nor in fine, in thoſe of the Apoſtolick Conſtitutions of <hi>St. Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and of the pretended <hi>Dennis</hi> the <hi>Arcopagite.</hi> But although the Author of this laſt, lived not at ſooneſt, but at the V. Century, I know not whether it may be ſaid, that the uſe of Sign of the Croſs was not practiced in the publick action of the Sacraments of the Church, ſeeing the contrary appears in the Writings of St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,
<note place="margin">Hom. 55. in Matth. p. 487.

I do not find that Croſſes were employed in the Service and Worſhip of Chriſtians; and beſides, the paſſages of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> may be underſtood of the Sign of the Croſs only, and not of the Croſs it ſelf,
<pb n="539" facs="tcp:47504:272"/>eſpecially if the paſſages are underſtood in their full compoſe and extent.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe things which have been examined, the Original whereof we have endeavoured to diſcover, there be ſome others which have been hinted at; as for inſtance, divers Hymns, as well regarding the Clergy, as the People; the reading the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; ſeveral prayers; the turning out of the Catechumeny, the Energumeny, and the Penitents; whereto we may add, in regard of the Greeks, the preparing the Oblation; that is to ſay, the Symbols of Bread and Wine upon the Table of Propoſition; the carrying of theſe gifts unto the Myſtical Table, to be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated; whereof we ſay nothing now, having treated thereof at large in the firſt Part of this Hiſtory. As alſo of the time, the place, and of the Veſſels neceſſary unto Celebration: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto may be joyned the Ceremony of Veſtments, appointed unto this uſe, whereof I find no mention at all made before Pope <hi>Syl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſter,</hi> who held the Pontifical See at the beginning of the IV.

The 41 Canon of the 4th Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> doth formally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe them the uſe of the Cope during the reading of the Goſpel, and at the time of Oblation only. St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> makes mention of White Veſtures in the celebration of the Sacrament; and in the Liturgy which goes in his name, may be ſeen the prayers made unto God, whilſt he that Officiates is putting on the holy Veſtments; an action which is not omitted by the Author of the Apoſtolick Conſtitutions, as hath been before ſhewed. Accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto which St. <hi>Jerom</hi> obſerves,
<note place="margin">Lib. 1. adverſ. Pelag. c. 9. p. 565. Ep. 3.</note> that all the Clergy have White Veſtures when the Euchariſt is celebrated, and in his Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unto <hi>Heliodorus</hi> upon the death of <hi>Nepotian,</hi> he ſaith, that <hi>Nepotian</hi> at his death bequeathed him the Coat which he uſed in doing the functions of a Prieſt. Since which time, in the Life of St. <hi>Gregory,</hi> by <hi>John</hi> the Deacon; and in the Authors which have treated of Divine Offices, there is frequent mention made of theſe Prieſtly Habits; for it cannot reaſonably be referred unto this cuſtom, what <hi>Policrates</hi> ſaid of St. <hi>John, That he bore a Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Plate upon his forehead,</hi> as the High Prieſts of the Jews did.</p>
                  <p>But all that is nothing in compariſon of what is ſeen in the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin Church; for there is to be ſeen ſix ſeveral ſorts of Veſtments, or if you will Ornaments, which belong unto the Prieſts which
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:47504:273"/>Officiate, and eight or nine unto the Biſhop; and there is not one of them, but they have ſearched ſome myſterious ſignification for it, and whereunto they have deſtined a particular Conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not to inſiſt of the diverſity of colours which are there to be ſeen, nor of the ſundry occaſions which ſometimes require one, ſometimes others; and the practice and uſe is eſteemed ſo neceſſary, that if it be ever ſo little neglected, the celebration of Maſs is in a manner counted imperfect. Thoſe which deſire particularly to inform themſelves of theſe things now hinted at, may but read what <hi>Durandus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mende,</hi> and the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent <hi>Duranti</hi> have writ on this ſubject. For it ſhall ſuffice me here to obſerve that Jeſus Chriſt and his Apoſtles, unto whom we may joyn the Chriſtians of the firſt Ages, did not celebrate the Euchariſt but in their ordinary Apparel. Therefore <hi>Walla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fridus Strabo</hi> wrote in the IX. Century, that Prieſtly Veſtments were multiplyed in time, unto the degree they were then in: <hi>For in the firſt Ages</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>Maſſes was celebrated with ordinary Apparel,
<note place="margin">Lib. de reb. Eccleſ. c. 24.</note> as it is ſaid that ſeveral in the Eaſtern Churches do ſtill practice:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Lib. 1. Gemm. amm. c. 89.</note> And <hi>Honorius</hi> of <hi>Autun</hi> ſaid about 400 years ago, <hi>That the Apoſtles and their Succeſſors, did celebrate the myſteries in their ordinary Cloaths, and with Challices of Wood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the bowings of the Body before a Crucifix, no more then before an Image, and before an Altar, which is ſo frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed amongſt the Latins by thoſe which ſay Maſs, I ſee no footſteps of it, neither in the conſtitutions which are called the Apoſtles, nor in St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> no, nor in the pretended <hi>Dennis</hi> the <hi>Arcopagite;</hi> whoſe Writings could not ſee light be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the end of the V. Century, although all of them have very exactly repreſented that which was obſerved in their times in the celebration of the Euchariſt; from whence I infer, that what is to be ſeen in one part of the Liturgy attributed unto St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom,</hi> to wit, <hi>That he that celebrates turns himſelf towards the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of Jeſus Chriſt, with bowing of the body,</hi> is not of this holy Doctor: but that in all likelihood it was foiſted into the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy ſince the conteſts of the Greeks about the ſubject of Images; and what confirms me in this thought is, that the favourers of Image Worſhip have not alledged theſe words, not ſo much as the Deacon <hi>Epiphanius</hi> in the ſecond Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> although he anſwers unto ſome paſſages of this Father which the <hi>Icono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claſticks</hi> had cited againſt this Worſhip. What might be alledged from a Homily which is in the works of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> and hath for Title, <hi>That there is one only Law-giver of the Old and New Teſtament,</hi> is of no moment, becauſe this Homily is none of his, as hath been long ſince remarked by <hi>Fronton du Duke</hi> a Learned

And theſe Inclinations proceed from ſeveral Idea's which this ſaving remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance doth ſtir up in our Souls, at the time in which we do pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare our ſelves for the participation of this adorable Myſtery of our Salvation: For although the Sacrament was inſtituted prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipally for remembring the death of our Saviour; nevertheleſs, becauſe his Death is inſeparable from his Incarnation, Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Aſcenſion, ſo it is that we approach unto the holy Communion, after having meditated on all theſe great and ſublime Myſteries; every one of which produceth in our Souls diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſomewhat different; as having divers objects, and ſeveral en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements; the which, nevertheleſs, are all heavenly, and all divine, and all which do tend unto one mark, and unto one end; which is, the Glory of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, and the eternal Salvation of our Souls. And to ſay the truth, this Sacrament cannot repreſent unto our eyes all theſe great and wonderful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, but that it opens unto us at the ſame time, a wide Field for our Meditation to enlarge upon, from the Incarnation of the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Word, even unto his ſecond coming to Judgment: and we cannot finiſh this glorious courſe, without having all the diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which God requires, and all the preparations which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires of us. This will plainly appear, if we do ſeverally reflect upon all the Idea's which the remembrance of our Saviour, and of his Sufferings, do preſent unto our Souls, and what the Fathers have ſaid upon each of them; and if we alſo feel the divine mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which will neceſſarily flow from the Chriſtian Soul. For example; The holy Fathers have conſidered the Euchariſt, as a Memorial, a Symbol, an Image, and a Sacrament of the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or, as the Doctors of the Greek Church ſpeak, of the Oe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conomy of Jeſus Chriſt; that is to ſay, of that free and merciful diſpenſation which inclined him to take our Nature in the Womb
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:47504:274"/>of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> by the miraculous operation of the Holy Ghoſt; which is what St. <hi>Juſtin Martyr</hi> would ſay, when he obſerved,
<note place="margin">Contr. Try. phon. p. 296.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Lord commanded us to make the Bread of the Euchariſt in remembrance, in that he was made Man for thoſe which ſhould believe in him.</hi> It was alſo the thoughts of <hi>Euſebius,
<note place="margin">Demonſtr. l. 8. a Geneſi.</note> That Jeſus Chriſt gave unto his Apoſtles the Symbols of his divine Oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, commanding them to make the Image of his true Body.</hi> And it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be any way doubted but it was on this ſame conſideration that Pope <hi>Gelaſius</hi> ſaid,
<note place="margin">De duabus in Chriſto natur.</note> 
                     <hi>That we do celebrate in the Action of the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the Image and reſemblance of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt; and that we muſt believe of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt that it ſelf which we profeſs in his Image, which we there celebrate, and there receive;</hi> that is to ſay, that we ſhould be perſuaded of the truth of his Fleſh and Blood, the Symbols and Sacraments whereof we do re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive at the holy Table. It is juſt what St. <hi>Leo</hi> intended to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs by theſe words, which were addreſſed unto the <hi>Eutychians; You ſhould communicate at the holy Table in ſuch a manner,
<note place="margin">Serm. 6. de je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jun. 7. menſis. pag. 86.</note> that you may not in the leaſt doubt of the truth of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> It is whereunto alſo attendeth all the paſſages of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which prove either againſt the <hi>Eutychians,</hi> or againſt the <hi>Docetes</hi> and the <hi>Putatifs,</hi> the truth of the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt by the Euchariſt, as the exiſtence of a thing is proved by the Image, and by the Figure which repreſents it;
<note place="margin">Dialog. 2. p. 84.</note> becauſe according to <hi>Theode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret</hi>'s ſaying; <hi>There muſt be an Arch-type of the Image, becauſe the Pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which imitate Nature, do repreſent the Images of things which are ſeen.</hi> From whence he draws this Concluſion; <hi>If the divine Myſteries are the Figure of a true Body, then the Body of our Lord is now alſo a true Body; not changed into the nature of the Divinity, but filled with the divine Glory.</hi> A Reaſoning for the moſt part like unto that of <hi>Tertullian</hi> againſt <hi>Marcian;</hi> for having expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded theſe words, <hi>This is my Body,</hi> by theſe others; <hi>That is to ſay,
<note place="margin">Lib. 4. adverſ. Marcion. c. 40.</note> the Figure of my Body:</hi> he adds, <hi>That it would not have been a Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure, if there had not been the truth of a Body, or a true Body.</hi> And indeed, this Idea of the Incarnation of our Lord was in ſuch a manner imprinted in the minds of Communicants, that the laſt Prayer of St. <hi>Baſil</hi>'s Liturgy begins thus. <hi>O Jeſus Chriſt, our God;
<note place="margin">Bibl. Patr. t. 2. Graeco-Lat.</note> we have accompliſhed and finiſhed, according to our power, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of thine Oeconomy and Diſpenſation.</hi> This Meditation, which repreſenteth unto us the horrour of ſin, the ſad condition we were in, the fearful Gulph wherein we have precipitated our ſelves, the Love of the Father, the tender Charity of the Son, the admirable work of our Redemption, the great Myſtery of Godlineſs, <hi>God manifeſt in the Fleſh,</hi> fills us full of Gratitude unto God. And if unto the Idea of his Conception and Birth, we joyn
<pb n="544" facs="tcp:47504:275"/>that of his Life, therein to contemplate the purity of his Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, the glory of his Miracles, the ſplendor of his Vertues, the efficacy of his Doctrine, and the ſhame of his Sufferings, we ſhall therein find ſo great joy, ſo great comfort, and ſo great pleaſure in the contemplation of this divine Scene, that we ſhall be inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly transformed into the ſame Image, <hi>from Glory unto Glory,</hi> to ſpeak with St. <hi>Paul;</hi> that is to ſay, from Holineſs to Holineſs.</p>
                  <p>But if the holy Fathers conſidered the Euchariſt as an Image of the Incarnation of Jeſus Chriſt, they have alſo more eſpecially conſidered it as the Memorial of his Death and Sufferings. That was it which was deſigned by St. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> when he ſaid, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt commanded us to make the Bread of the Euchariſt in remembrance of the death which he ſuffered for thoſe,
<note place="margin">Contr. Tryph. p. 259.</note> whoſe Souls are cleanſed from all ſin.</hi> And <hi>Tatian,</hi> who had been at the School of this excellent Maſter,
<note place="margin">Diateſſ. t. 7. Bibl. Pat.</note> obſerves, <hi>That the Lord commanded his Apoſtles to eat the Bread and drink the Euchariſt, becauſe it was the Memorial of his approaching Suffering and Death.</hi> It was alſo in the ſame Contemplation that St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſpake,
<note place="margin">1 L. 83. quaeſt. q. 61.</note> 
                     <hi>Of celebrating the Image of his Sacrifice, in remembrance of his Paſſion,

                  </p>
                  <p>This Remembrance brings into our minds divers Ideas, which do all contribute unto the ſanctifying of the Communicant. In the firſt place, an Idea of the ſtrict Juſtice of God; who not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to pardon us, without firſt receiving a ſatisfaction; choſe rather to abandon his own Son unto the moſt bitter, and ſharpeſt of all torments, and unto the moſt ſhameful death, than to ſee us periſh eternally. Therefore the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That God appointed him from all Eternity,
<note place="margin">Rom. 3.</note> to be a Propitiation, by Faith in his Blood, thereby to declare his Righteouſneſs:</hi> that is to ſay, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Interpretation of <hi>Origen; That God in the fulneſs of time,
<note place="margin">In Rom. 3.</note> and in theſe laſt Ages, hath ſhewed his Juſtice, and hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for a Saviour, him which he had appointed, to make a Pripitia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for our Offences; for God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is juſt; and being juſt, he could not juſtifie Sinners; therefore he would have the Redeemer to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſe, to the end that thoſe which could not be juſtified by their own Works, might be ſaved by believing in his Name.</hi> Secondly, The Idea of our ſins, which had rendred us Slaves unto the Devil, and
<pb n="545" facs="tcp:47504:275"/>unto Death:
<note place="margin">In Pſ. 95.</note> for <hi>Mankind</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin) was held Captive un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Satan, and were ſubject unto Devils.</hi> And that of the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God, and of his great love towards men;
<note place="margin">John. 3.</note> 
                     <hi>For he ſo loved the World, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believed in him, ſhould not periſh, but ſhould have eternal Life.</hi> Whence it is that St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaid, <hi>That he gave him unto us,
<note place="margin">Serm. 1. de ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent. Domin.</note> becauſe his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion is great, his mercies are many in number, and his love is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</hi> It was the Humiliation of Jeſus Chriſt, and the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing greatneſs of his Love, which moved him to die for us. It was the thought of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> when he ſaid,
<note place="margin">Con. duas Epiſt. Pelag. l. 4. c. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>Jeſus Chriſt was plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to undergo death for us, that is to ſay, the puniſhment of ſin, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſin; for as he only was made the Son of Man, to the end that we ſhould become the Children of God; ſo alſo he alone ſuffered the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for us, not having deſerved it, to the end that by him we ſhould obtain forgiveneſs, without having deſerved it; becauſe that as we deſerved no good, ſo alſo he on his part merited no evil: he bare our puniſhment, not being guilty, thereby to cancil our Obligation, and to put an end unto our puniſhment.</hi> In fine, the Remembrance whereof we ſpeak, repreſents unto us the infinite price of his Blood for our Redemption:
<note place="margin">Euſeb. demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrat. l. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>For it is this great and ineſtimable price</hi> (ſaith an ancient Biſhop) <hi>which, according to the teſtimony of the Prophets, was to redeem the Jews and the Gentiles; this Sacrifice for the whole World, this Offering for the Souls of all Mankind, this pure Hoſtage for all Sins, this Lamb of God, of whom the Prophets have ſaid ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny things, and by whoſe divine and myſtical Doctrine, we all, which were Gentiles, have found forgiveneſs of ſins; and all thoſe amongſt the Jews which have hoped in his Name, deliverance from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction of the Law.</hi> All theſe Conſiderations create in our Souls a holy and religious dread of offending a God, whoſe Juſtice is ſo ſevere, and whoſe tender mercies alſo are ſo great (a God, who being of right our Judge, choſe rather to become our Father, and to ſave us by his Grace, when he might juſtly have puniſhed us in his Anger) a mortal and irreconcilable hatred againſt all ſin and wickedneſs; a firm reſolution of warring againſt it, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to lay down Arms until we have overcome it; a true and hearty reliance of flying unto the merciful Throne of our Saviour, an ardent Zeal for his Glory, an abſolute renouncing of the World, and of our own ſelves, to the end, not to live but unto him on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſeeing he hath ſo lovingly ſhed his Blood for our Salvation; and for a fulneſs of felicity, ſo ardent a love for this bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, that each faithful Communicant may ſay in that bleſſed moment, with the Spouſe, <hi>I am my Beloveds, and my Beloved is mine.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="546" facs="tcp:47504:276"/>
                  <p>Moreover, the ſame holy Doctors of the Church have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templated the Sacrament as a Memorial of the bleſſed Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction,
<note place="margin">Baſil. de Bapt. cap. 3. p. 581.</note> ſaying, that we participate thereof, <hi>To put us always in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of him which is riſen again for us.</hi> This Remembrance aſſures us, that the object of our hope, of our confidence, and of our faith,
<note place="margin">Rom. 1.</note> is not Man only, but that he is God alſo; <hi>for he was declared to be the Son of God, by the Reſurrection from the Dead.</hi> He aſſureth us, that his Satisfaction was accepted of his Father for our diſcharge, and that it had the vertue and power to appeaſe his wrath, and to reconcile us unto him. From thence it is, that the Apoſtle ſaith not only,
<note place="margin">Rom. 4.</note> 
                     <hi>That he was delivered for our ſins;</hi> but alſo, <hi>That he roſe again for our Juſtification.</hi> And in fine, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures us, that this Reſurrection, which juſtifies us before God, ſhould ſhew its efficacy in the death of our Old Man, and in the crucifying the Fleſh and the Luſts thereof;
<note place="margin">Rom. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>For we are buried to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with him in his death by Baptiſm; that as Jeſus Chriſt is rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed from the dead, by the glory of the Father, ſo alſo we ſhould walk in newneſs of life.</hi> And if we would know what this Reſurrection is, which St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires of a Chriſtian, St. <hi>Ghryſoſtom</hi> will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us,
<note place="margin">Hom. 10. in c. 6. Rom.</note> 
                     <hi>That it is a holy Converſation which proceedeth from the change of Manners, the death of Sin, the reſtoring of Righteouſneſs, and the entire ruin of the old Life, to eſtabliſh one that is new, and wholly Angelical.</hi> Therefore it is that <hi>Theodoret,</hi> interpreting theſe ſame words,
<note place="margin">In c. 6. Rom.</note> gives us this excellent Leſſon; <hi>The Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm teacheth us to fly from ſin, for Baptiſm is a type of the death of our Saviour; now by it you participate with Jeſus Chriſt of death, and alſo of the Reſurrection: you muſt then lead a new life, and agreeable unto him, of whoſe Reſurrection you have been made to participate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Unto the Remembrance of Chriſt's Reſurrection, theſe holy Doctors joyn alſo that of his Aſcenſion and Glory; therefore it is they ſay,
<note place="margin">Gaudent. tr. 2. tom. 2. Bibl. Pat.</note> 
                     <hi>That the Sacrament is the</hi> Viaticum <hi>of our journey, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with we are nouriſhed by the way, until we come unto him at our leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this World; a pledge of his preſence, and a portraict of his paſſion, until he comes again from Heaven.</hi> And in preparing our ſelves for the Sacrament, we cannot make this reflection, but that we muſt bewail his abſence; but yet comforting our ſelves with this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, that he is ſitting on the Throne of his Father, as Lord of Heaven and Earth, the Maſter of all things, and the Monarch of the whole Univerſe. That it is from thence that he ſends forth his Commands into all the World, that he diſpenſeth the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of God, that he defends his people, that he protects his Church, and that he reſtraineth the pride and inſolency of his Enemies: but that we muſt at the ſame inſtant be raiſed with heavenly thoughts, divine motions, and ſpiritual affections; to
<pb n="547" facs="tcp:47504:276"/>be lifted up unto him by holy ejaculations, and to contemplate him ſhining with Glory in Heaven, after having meditated on him; all covered with ſhame upon Earth, and nailed upon the Croſs in Mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> for the expiating of the ſins of Men, and for the work of our Redemption. Therefore the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers deſire we would become like unto Eagles,
<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. Hom. 24. in 1. ad Corinth.</note> 
                     <hi>To fly up unto Heaven, that we ſhould have nothing of Earth in us, that we ſhould not bend downwards, that we ſhould not wallow in the love of the Creatures; but that we ſhould inceſſantly fly towards the things above, and that we ſhould ſtedfaſtly behold the Sun of Righteouſneſs, with an earneſt ſight, and piercing eyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In fine, the ancient Liturgies do not from all theſe Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, ſeparate that of his ſecond coming. Which maketh us think of that great and laſt day, wherein the Dead ſhall be raiſed, wherein the Books ſhall be opened, and wherein ſhall be the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Judgment, to caſt the Wicked into Hell, and to receive the Good into the felicity and glory of Heaven; then there ſhall be no more want of Sacraments: for, as <hi>Theodoret</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">In 1 ad Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinth. c. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>After his ſecond coming, we ſhall have no farther need of the ſigns and Symbols of the Body, becauſe the Body it ſelf will appear:</hi> but until that time, the Celebration thereof is abſolutely neceſſary, according to this Obſervation of the Author of the Commentaries upon the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> attributed unto St. <hi>Jerom,

                     <p>Of the Motions and Diſpoſitions of the Communicant in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Sacrament.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>AS the remembrance which our Saviour commands us to make of him, and of his death, when we receive the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, comprehends all the Qualifications which we ought to have in regard of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, ſo alſo the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion required by St. <hi>Paul</hi> contains all thoſe which we ought to have in regard of the Sacrament:
<note place="margin">1 Cor. 11.</note> 
                     <hi>Let every one</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>prove his own ſelf.</hi> But it is not ſufficient to ſay, that the Apoſtle en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyns Communicants unto this Examination; we muſt alſo know wherein it doth conſiſt; to this purpoſe, I ſay, that what St. <hi>Paul</hi> requires of us is an act whereby we muſt ſearch our hearts, look into every corner of it, whereby we examine every part of our Soul: we muſt aſſure our ſelves of the ſtate wherein it is; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Faith hath therein taken its place, whether Hope lifted us up in expectation of the happineſs promiſed, and whether the Love of Jeſus Chriſt, and of our Neighbour, therein unfolds its vertue and efficacy. In a word, it is an act whereby we diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver whether we be fitting to approach unto the holy Table; for in coming thither, we proteſt that Jeſus Chriſt is our Maſter, and our Lord; that it is he which hath redeemed us by his Blood, and that hath purchaſed Life for us by his Death. And as the Apoſtle enjoyneth this Law unto all Communicants, it may be ſaid that this Trial doth conſiſt in the ſerious and ſincere Exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which every one makes of his Conſcience, to know in what ſtate and diſpoſition it is. Whence it may be gathered, that it deſires no Witneſſes, but that it ſhould be done in private, and in ſecret, in the preſence of God only; for there it is that the Sinner calls himſelf to an account, that he reflects upon his life paſt, that he condemns his wicked actions, that he groans under the thoughts of his ſins, that he deeply mourns for the greatneſs of his offences, that he cleanſeth his heart, and purifies his Soul by the tears of Repentance, and by the working of a true Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition. But becauſe the Latin Church defines in the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> whoſe Decretes are to be conſidered as the Confeſſion of Faith of the Latin Church,
<note place="margin">Seſſ. 13. c. 7.</note> 
                     <hi>That the cuſtom of the Church declares, that the neceſſary proof is, that how contrite ſoever the ſinner feels him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he ought not to approach unto the holy Euchariſt, without having firſt made his ſacramental Confeſſion; that it muſt of neceſſity be made;
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:47504:277"/>that without it, one receives this Sacrament unworthily, unto his death and condemnation.</hi> We are obliged to enquire what was the Conduct of the ancient Church in this occaſion; for it is not my intention to examine the matter of Confeſſion in all its parts, but only in that which concerns my ſubject. To do it in ſome order, it muſt be obſerved, that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> reſtrains the neceſſity of this Confeſſion before communicating, unto thoſe which feel themſelves guilty of mortal ſin;
<note place="margin">Concil Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran. c. 21.</note> whereas <hi>Innocent</hi> the Third had thereunto ſubjected, without any diſtinction, all thoſe which had attained the age of diſcretion,
<note place="margin">In. 3. Thom. <hi>q.</hi> 80. art. 4.</note> in his Council of <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran, Anno</hi> 1215. Secondly, That Cardinal <hi>Cajetan</hi> doth not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Confeſſion abſolutely neceſſary unto the Communion, if one have a real Contrition; ſaying, <hi>This neceſſity is not founded neither upon the Commandments of God, nor of the Church, nor upon the Law, nor natural reaſon.</hi> In the third place, That here is not queſtion of publick ſins which fell under the Canons of publick Penance, becauſe thoſe ſins excluded thoſe which were guilty of them from receiving of the Sacrament; unto which they were not admitted, until they had fulfilled the time of their laborious Penance; which preſuppoſed Confeſſion, or at leaſt, the Convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of thoſe ſins which indiſpenſibly obliged ſinners to undergo the Laws, and bear the yoke of this Penance. Here is the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion of the neceſſity of the Confeſſion of the Latin Church, which comprehends all mortal ſins univerſally, without diſpenſing with any body from confeſſing them in private unto a Prieſt, before they approach unto the Communion. Thereupon I ſay, that if it be true, as all the World doth agree, that the Communion was very frequent in the primitive Church; inſomuch as ſome do think, that they communicated every day. It is very hard to conceive how twelve Apoſtles could ſuffice to receive the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of the Believers of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 2.41. &amp; 4.4.</note> I will not ſay, every day, but even once a Week, after the Converſion of eight thouſand perſons in two Sermons by St. <hi>Peter.</hi> What I ſay of the Church of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> I ſay alſo of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi>

Now I cannot tell whether it was poſſible they could hear the Confeſſions of thirty or forty thouſand Believers, whereof this Church in all probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity was compoſed, and to hear them once or twice a Week;

                     <hi>Of the care which ſhould be taken in receiving of the Euchariſt.</hi> In reading this Title it came into my mind, that the Fathers of the Council might haply have compriſed Auricular Confeſſion in the preparations which they commanded; yet nevertheleſs, I do not find therein any ſuch thing: they only warn, <hi>That a great deal of care muſt be taken in participating of the Body and Blood of our Lord, and take care that we do not abſtain from it too long, leſt that ſhould turn unto the ruin of the Soul; and that if one partake thereof indiſcreetly, we ſhould fear what the Apoſtle ſaith;</hi> Whoſoever eateth and drinketh unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily, eateth and drinketh his own Damnation. <hi>A man ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to examine himſelf, according to the Command of the ſame Apoſtle; and ſo eat of this Bread, and drink of this Cup; that is to ſay, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelf for the receiving of ſo great a Sacrament in abſtaining ſome days from the works of the Fleſh, and in purifying of his Body and Soul.

<note place="margin">De concord. l. 4. c. 2.</note> as <hi>Arcudius,</hi> a Greek Latinized, doth inform us. And as for the Proteſtants, every body knows they have found this Yoke of the Latins too heavy to bear. But if the holy Fathers have not hitherto demanded private Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion before coming unto the Table of our Lord, they do require other diſpoſitions, without which they forbid us approaching un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it.

<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. Hom 3. in c. 1. ad E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſ. p. 1050, 1051.</note> 
                     <hi>It is not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the</hi> Epiphany, <hi>nor the</hi> Lent, <hi>that renders us worthy to approach unto the holy Sacrament: it is the ſincerity and purity of heart: therewith draw near at all times; and without them, never come unto it. Conſider with what care, and with what reſpect the Fleſh of Sacrifices was eaten under the Law; What caution did they not uſe, what trouble were they not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually at to purifie themſelves to that purpoſe? And you, approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unto a Sacrifice which the very Angels behold with a religious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, you think it is ſufficient to prepare your ſelves unto ſo ſolemn an action, by governing your ſelves according to the courſe of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Conſider the Veſſels which are employed for the Celebration of this Sacrament; how clean they be, how bright and ſhining they be: yet nevertheleſs, our Souls ſhould be cleaner, more holy, and more reſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent than theſe Veſſels; ſeeing that it is only for us that they be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</hi> And in another place, ſpeaking of ſeldom and often receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacrament,
<note place="margin">Id. Hom. 17: in Ep. ad Heb. p. 1872.</note> 
                     <hi>We regard not</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>neither thoſe which communicate often, nor thoſe which communicate ſeldom; but thoſe which communicate with a ſincere Conſcience, a pure heart, and an unreprovable life. Let thoſe that are in this condition always draw near; and thoſe which are not, let them not ſo much as once draw near; becauſe they only draw upon themſelves the wrath of God, and make themſelves worthy of Condemnation, of pains, and of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, which ſhould not ſeem ſtrange unto us: for as Meats which
<pb n="553" facs="tcp:47504:279"/>are wholſom of themſelves. being received into a diſeaſed Body, there cauſeth a diſorder, and an entire corruption, and becomes the Original of ſome diſeaſe; ſo it is the ſame of theſe terrible and venerable Myſteries, when they be received into Souls which be indiſpoſed.</hi> And becauſe the holy Fathers conſidered that this auguſt Sacrament, which giveth life unto ſome, gives death unto others; that is to ſay, unto thoſe which receive it unworthily: and that if it be full of conſolation unto holy Souls, it is alſo full of terror unto the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked.

<note place="margin">Hom. 21. in Act</note> a dreadful Sacrament is repreſented: God gave himſelf for the World.</hi> From thence came the Exhortation addreſſed unto the people in the ancient Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies, to call them unto the Communion; <hi>Draw near with fear:</hi>

<note place="margin">1 Theoria re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Eccleſ. t. 2 Bibl. Pat. Grec. vel Lat. p. 407.</note> 
                     <hi>That God takes pleaſure in giving holy things unto thoſe which be pure of heart.</hi> And then the Sacrament doth not a little contribute unto the augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of this purity, according unto what is ſpoken by <hi>Theophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria;
<note place="margin">2 Ep. Paſch. 2.</note> That we break the Bread of our Lord for our Sanctification.</hi> And Pope <hi>Gelaſius,
<note place="margin">3 De duab. nat. Chriſt.</note> That the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Body and Blood of our Saviour renders us partakers of the divine Nature.</hi> And to ſay the truth,
<note place="margin">4 In Anaceph.</note> 
                     <hi>There is in the Bread a vertue that quickens us,</hi> as St. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> doth teſtifie. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, the Sacrament effecting in regard of our Souls, what a good Medicine doth operate in regard of our bodies, there is no queſtion to be made, but when the ancient Doctors of the Church have contemplated it under this Idea, but that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="554" facs="tcp:47504:280"/>that Communicants ſhould at the leaſt uſe as much care and caution unto the reception of this divine Medicine, as we are wont to take when we intend to purge our Bodies: for when we intend to take Phyſick, we live the day before within ſome bounds, and are careful not to ſurcharge the Stomach, that it might ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate with more eaſe and profit for the purging out of peccant hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours. In like manner when we are to preſent our ſelves at the holy Table of the Church, we ſhould prepare and diſpoſe our Souls to receive this ſaving Remedy, the vertue and efficacy where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhews, and maketh it ſelf to be felt, in healing the ſpiritual Maladies wherewith we are naturally oppreſſed. This was in all likelihood the thoughts of <hi>Hillary,</hi> Deacon of <hi>Rome,</hi> when he ſaid,
<note place="margin">Apud Ambroſ. in c. 18. 1. ad Cor.</note> 
                     <hi>That although this Myſtery was celebrated at Supper, yet it is not a Supper, but a ſpiritual Medicine which purifieth thoſe which come unto it with devotion, and which do receive it with reſpect.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Sacrament having been inſtituted to give unto us the Communion of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>becauſe that in participa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of this viſible Bread, one eats ſpiritually the Fleſh of Chriſt,</hi> to ſpeak with St.
<note place="margin">Hom. 27.</note> 
                     <hi>Macarius;</hi> is it not juſt that we ſhould purifie and ſanctifie our Souls to be the Palace and Temple of this merciful Saviour; to the end that there delighting to make his abode and reſidence, he might ſpread abroad his Graces, his Bleſſings, and his favours, and that he may inceſſantly apply unto them the fruits of his death; wherein they find their life, their joy, their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, and their ſalvation. In fine, The Sacrament being to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us a Symbol of Unity, a Band of Charity, and of Peace, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the conſtant Doctrine of the holy Fathers; they deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that Believers ſhould maintain a holy Concord amongſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and a perfect Union, that they ſhould be careful of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the Unity of the Spirit in the Band of Peace; and that they ſhould put on unto each other bowels of pity and of Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. Therefore they would not receive Oblations of thoſe which were not reconciled; and not accepting them, they admitted them not unto the Sacrament; for the one neceſſarily depended upon the other. Therefore they warned Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, at the time of the Communion, to ſalute each other, and to give each other the holy Kiſs mentioned by St. <hi>Paul</hi> in one of his Epiſtles.
<note place="margin">Myſtag. 5.</note> 
                     <hi>The Deacons cry</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi>) <hi>embrace, and mutually kiſs each other; and then we ſalute one another: But do not think that it is ſuch a kiſs as common friends do give unto each other when they meet in the publick place. This Kiſs doth unite Souls, and makes them hope a perfect forgetfulneſs of what is paſt: it is a ſign of the uniting of ſpirits, and not retaining the memory of injuries any lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. And therefore alſo it is that our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt the Son of
<pb n="555" facs="tcp:47504:280"/>God ſaid,</hi> When you bring your Gift unto the Altar, and that you there remember that your Brother hath ought againſt you, leave there thy Gift before the Altar, and go firſt be reconciled with thy Brother, and then come offer thy Gift. <hi>This Kiſs then is a Reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and by conſequence is holy. And it is of this Kiſs St.</hi> Paul <hi>ſpeaketh, when he ſaid,</hi> Greet one another with a holy Kiſs; <hi>and St.</hi> Peter, Salute each other with a Kiſs of Charity. And they believed this Union ſo neceſſary, that without it, as they thought, one could receive no benefit by the Sacrament, how much ſoever other ways one was addicted unto good works. Whence it is that St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> after having exalted the vertue and efficacy of this holy Kiſs which uniteth Souls, reconciles Spirits, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth us all to become one Body, he exhorts his Auditors ſtrictly to unite their Souls by the Bands of Charity, to the end they might with aſſurance enjoy the Fruits of the Table which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for them; he adds, <hi>Although we abound in good works,
<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. de praed. iud. t. 5. p. 465.</note> if we neglect the Reconciliation of Peace, we ſhall reap no advantage for our Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All the Liturgies come to our hands, make mention of this Kiſs of Charity which Believers gave each other before the Sacrament, and which St. <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>a holy Kiſs,</hi> and St. <hi>Peter, a Kiſs of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity;</hi> many of the ancient Fathers do alſo make mention of it. Indeed, the time of kiſſing each other was not alike in all Churches; in ſome it was given before the Conſecration of the Symbols, and in others juſt at the time of communicating; but however, it was the manner to ſalute each other before approaching unto the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Table. And this cuſtom continued a very great while in the Church, but at length it inſenſibly vaniſhed, at leaſt, in the Weſt; and the Latins have put inſtead of this mutual Kiſs, that which they call, <hi>Kiſs the Peace;</hi> which is a kind of little Silver Plate, or of ſome other matter, with the Image of Jeſus Chriſt, or the Relicks of ſome Saint, which is offered unto each perſon to kiſs; a cuſtom not very ancient, ſeeing it was never heard of until the end of the XV. Century;
<note place="margin">Lect. 81.</note> for then it began to be introduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſome Churches in the Weſt, as is obſerved by <hi>Gabriel Biel,</hi> in ſome of his Leſſons upon the Canon of the Maſs. Beſides, it is not ſaid in the Liturgies, whether this Kiſs was given indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently amongſt Men and Women:
<note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 32.</note> I only obſerve in the Books of Eccleſiaſtical Offices of <hi>Amalarius Fortunatus,</hi> who wrote in the IX. Century; and in the <hi>Rational</hi> of <hi>Durandus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Mende,</hi>

                  <p>And becauſe all theſe diſpoſitions are not the fruits of Nature, but Gifts of the Grace and Mercy of God, the ancient Chriſtians addreſſed themſelves unto him by devout Prayers, to the end he would be pleaſed to beſtow upon them what they wanted; that is, the preparations neceſſary to communicate ſavingly and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thily. <hi>Caſſander</hi> hath collected ſeveral of theſe Prayers; but they being penned variouſly, according to the motions of the Devotion of the Communicants, we forbear inſerting them in this place, to endeavour to diſcover, in proſecuting our deſign, whether the holy Fathers, which have required theſe diſpoſitions before draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near unto the holy Table, have alſo required that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants ſhould adore the Sacrament in the Act of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting.</p>

                     <p>Wherein the Queſtion of the Adoration of the Sacrament is examined.</p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>WEll to explain a matter, and to give it the full demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which it requires, the nature of the queſtion muſt firſt of all be plainly ſtated, becauſe it is thereupon moſt common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the clearing of it doth chiefly depend. Being therefore to treat of ſo weighty a Subject as that which now offers it ſelf, the firſt thing we ſhould do is, carefully to put a difference betwixt Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, and his Sacrament; for the queſtion is not, whether Jeſus Chriſt ought to be worſhipped; all Chriſtians are agreed upon this point: But whether the Sacrament ſhould be adored, that is to ſay, that which the Prieſt holds in his hands, and which is commonly called the <hi>Hoſtie,</hi> and the Sacrament; for it appears to me, that the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> hath agreed this to be the true ſtate of the Queſtion,
<note place="margin">Seſſ. 13. c. 5.</note> when it defined, <hi>That there is no doubt to be made but all the Servants of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould render unto the holy Sacrament in the act of Veneration, the worſhip of</hi> Latry <hi>which is due unto the true God.</hi> It muſt then in the firſt place be acknowledged as an unqueſtionable Truth, that Jeſus Chriſt is an Object truly adorable, and that his Fleſh it ſelf deſerves that we ſhould render it the higheſt Religious Worſhip, by reaſon of the privilege it hath of being united into one perſon with his eternal Divinity. When therefore the holy Fathers ſpeak of adoring Jeſus Chriſt in the participation of the Sacrament, they ſay nothing whereunto the Proteſtants do not acquieſce, as well as the Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks;

An adoration unto which may be referred what is ſaid by <hi>Origen,</hi> or at leaſt the Author of ſome Homilies that are in his Works. <hi>What we read</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>in the Goſpel,
<note place="margin">Hom. 5. in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſ. t. 2. p. 285.</note> ought not to be paſſed over by us as a thing of ſmall importance; That the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion ſaid unto Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> I am not worthy that thou ſhouldſt enter under my Roof; <hi>for at this time Jeſus Chriſt doth yet enter under the Roof of Believers by two Figures, or after two manner of ways;</hi> viz. <hi>When holy men, beloved of God, which govern the Churches, enter under your Roof, then our Lord doth enter by them; and you ſhould believe that you receive our Saviour: When alſo you receive the holy and incorruptible Food, the Bread of Life, I ſay, and the Cup, you do eat and drink the Body and Blood of our Saviour; and then our Lord doth enter under your Roof. Humble your ſelves therefore, and in imitation of the Centurion, ſay,</hi> Lord I am not worthy that thou ſhouldſt enter under my Roof: <hi>for whereſoever he enters unworthily, he there enters for the condemnation of him which receiveth him.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He ſaith, That our Saviour enters under our Roof by his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, after the ſame manner as he there enters by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters; and that we ſhould humble our ſelves in receiving as well his Servants, as his Sacrament: to the end this act of humility may be a mark of the adoration which we give unto him which hath inſtituted the one, and which ſendeth unto us the others, confeſſing that we are not worthy of this favour. St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> and St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> expreſs themſelves ſo fully, that the Reader will find no difficulty to penetrate into their meaning; for ſee here what is ſaid by the firſt,
<note place="margin">Ambroſ de Spir. S. l. 3. c. 12</note> 
                     <hi>We adore the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt in the Myſteries.</hi> He puts a difference betwixt the Myſteries, and the Fleſh of Jeſus Chriſt, which he makes to be the Object of our Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip in the act of communicating. I will not now inſiſt upon the manner of Jeſus Chriſts being preſent in the Sacrament, becauſe that hath been treated of at large in the Second Part; I only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the teſtimonies of Ancient Doctors, which ſpeak of adoring our Saviour when we communicate, to the end not to divert the Examination we are to make of the Adoration of the Sacrament. Therefore we will joyn unto St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> who ſaith,

                  <p>How, ſay ſome, is it poſſible St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſhould teach that the Sacrament ſhould be adored, ſeeing he ſo formally denies it in one of his Letters; for ſpeaking of things ſenſible and corporeal, I mean of Creatures whereof the Scripture makes uſe to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent things Spiritual and Heavenly, he ſaith, <hi>That they ought not to be adored;</hi> although we ſhould draw Images and Reſemblances of the Myſteries of our Salvation; and he puts in the rank of theſe ſigns which we ſhould not adore,
<note place="margin">Ep. 119. ad Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuar. cap. 6.</note> 
                     <hi>The Water and Oyle of Baptiſm,</hi> the Bread and Wine of the Sacrament; without ſaying any thing more particularly for the one than the other.</p>
                  <p>It is unto Jeſus Chriſt that he deſires we ſhould addreſs our Adoration, without ſpeaking one word of the Sacrament, by means whereof he communicates unto us his Fleſh: I know not whether any other Interpretation can be given unto the words of S. <hi>Chryſoſtom:
<note place="margin">Homil. 24. in 1. ad Corinth.</note> You do not only ſee the ſame Body which was ſeen by the Wiſe man; but you alſo know the vertue, and all the diſpenſation of it, and are not ignorant of the things which he did and accompliſhed. Being well informed of all theſe Myſteries, let us then ſtir up our ſelves, let us be ſeized with aſtoniſhment, and let us teſtifie yet greater reſpect then was ſhewed by the Wiſe men.</hi> It is evident, that this reſpect and veneration hath reference unto the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, as the Adoration of the Wiſe men had; which adored him when they ſaw him in the Manger at <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> as Communicants adore him, when they ſee him not in himſelf, but in his Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof he grants them the favour to participate. All the World doth confeſs that Jeſus Chriſt is not any more viſible unto the Eyes of Men ſince his Aſcenſion into Heaven. I think that it is ſo alſo are to be underſtood the Adorations ſpoken of in a Liturgy which is attributed unto St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> but cannot be his, the Author being much younger than him. There be ſome alſo which attribute it unto <hi>John</hi> the Second, called the Mute, Patriarch of the ſame Church, but about 200 years after St. <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtom;</hi> and yet neither is it very certain that it is of this <hi>John.</hi> To conclude, the Copies are very different; for in that amongſt the works of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> there is no mention made of Adoring but once, when the Goſpel is carried, and when 'tis lifted up; becauſe then the <hi>Choir</hi> ſaith,

It is true, theſe ſorts of Adorations are there practiſed before the Conſecration and after; which plainly ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth they were addreſſed unto God, and unto Jeſus Chriſt; becauſe the Bread and Wine, by the Doctrine it ſelf of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are not to be adored until after Conſecration. The thing will appear yet plainer, if we conſider the prayers which be there made when they diſpoſe themſelves unto the Communion.

<pb n="560" facs="tcp:47504:283"/>the King Immortal;</hi> it can admit of no other Interpretation: for I do not here examine what was the belief of the Ancient Church upon the point of the Sacrament, I only inquire what the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents have ſaid of the Adoration of Jeſus Chriſt in the Act of communicating, not to confound the Adoration of the Maſter, with the Adoration of the Sacrament. Therefore unto all the paſſages which have been alledged, I will yet add two others, unto which, if I miſtake not, the ſame Explication ought to be given. The firſt is taken from a fragment of the life of <hi>Luke</hi> the <hi>Ancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi> who lived in the X. Century; wherein is read theſe words, <hi>You ſhould ſing Pſalms which are ſuitable unto this Myſtery;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">In auctar. Franciſ. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bef. t. 2. p. 986.</note> and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Greek, <hi>Typical Pſalms, and which do repreſent it,</hi> Or, <hi>the Hymn called Tryſagion, with the Symbol of the Creed; then you ſhall three times bow the Knees, and joyning the hands, you ſhall with the mouth participate of the precious body of Jeſus Chriſt our God.</hi> It is eaſie to ſee that theſe three Genuflections, have rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto him to whom the Tryſagion was ſung, that is to ſay, unto God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, of whom they beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Grace to communicate worthily. I place in the ſame rank the Hiſtory of St. <hi>Theoctiſta,</hi> who having lived 35 years in a wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs in the Iſle of <hi>Paros,</hi> deſired a Huntſman whom ſhe met by accident, that he would the year following bring her the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament;
<note place="margin">Apud Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraſt. in vit. S. Theoctiſt. c. 13.</note> which the Huntſman having done, the Saint caſt her ſelf upon the ground, received the Divine Gift; and wetting the ground with her tears, ſhe ſaid, <hi>Lord now let thy Servant depart in peace, becauſe mine eyes have ſeen the Saviour which thou haſt given us;</hi> or, as Cardinal <hi>du Perron</hi> hath tranſlated, <hi>Becauſe mine eyes have ſeen thy healthineſs.</hi> After what way ſoever theſe words are taken, nothing elſe can lawfully be gathered, but that this Maid being tranſported with a holy joy, in that God was pleaſed to give her the benefit of participating of this Divine Myſtery, of the enjoyment whereof ſhe had been ſo long deprived; ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly humbles her ſelf in his preſence, in rendring thanks for procuring her ſo great a benefit, and ſo ſweet and ſolid a Conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation; not to ſpeak of Cardinal <hi>Baronius</hi> his often undervaluing <hi>Metaphraſtus,</hi> who relates the life of this Saint. But beſides this firſt conſideration, we muſt make a ſecond, which is no leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to the clearing of the matter whereof we treat.

<note place="margin">7 Ibid. p. 26.27.</note> adorable Altar, and of the adoration of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable places; and ſo in an infinite number of places which need not be recited. This word then having divers ſignifications, it is but juſt and right, when it is found in diſcourſe, to explain it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Nature of the ſubject then in hand; for example, if there be mention of the three perſons of the bleſſed Trinity, it muſt neceſſarily be tranſlated by that of adoring, becauſe the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, be objects worthy of our Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: but if things truly Sacred and Religious are ſpoken of, but yet nevertheleſs are not (to ſpeak in a proper ſenſe) adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, it is to be tranſlated by <hi>venerated,</hi> and <hi>reſpected;</hi> for by this means it will be eaſie to reſolve and clear all the difficulties which ſeem to entangle this matter; according unto which, if any of the Ancients treating of the Bread and Wine of the Euchariſt, make uſe of the term which we examine, it will not be difficult unto us to underſtand, that his deſign is not that we ſhould adore them, but only that we ſhould venerate them, and that we ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect them as Sacraments, which Jeſus Chriſt hath inſtituted for the ſaving of our Souls; eſpecially if this Writer doth formally declare, that the Bread and Wine do not change their Subſtance by Conſecration.

And in fine, there be learned men amongſt the Latins which do ſo explain themſelves. But ſome others do think that this Explication doth require to be made more plain; for ſay they, if it be only meant, that in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating we ſhould adore Jeſus Chriſt, proſtrate, and as it may be ſaid, become vile in his ſight, as we do with reverence take his Sacrament, there is no Chriſtian but will agree thereunto; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though it is not, as they think, the meaning of <hi>Theodoret;</hi> but if they intend this relative Adoration ſhould ſo terminate in Jeſus Chriſt, as that the Symbols ſhould alſo have their part, it is to eſtabliſh the quite contrary of what is ſaid by <hi>Theodoret,</hi> who leaves only a Reſpect and Veneration to be given unto the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

I ſay then, in the inſtitution of this Sacrament which is exactly deſcribed unto us, I find that our Saviour, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving broke the Bread which he had taken and conſecrated, gave it unto his Diſciples; ſaying unto them, <hi>Take, eat;</hi> and that he alſo in like manner commanded them to take the Cup, and drink of it: but I do not find that he commanded them to adore neither the one, nor the other. But if we do not find that he commanded them to adore what he gave unto them, neither do we read that the Apoſtles did adore the Euchariſt. The Evangeliſts, which have ſo exactly tranſmitted unto us the Hiſtory of this Inſtitution, in ſo exactly marking all the Circumſtances of it, ſpeak not a word of the holy Apoſtles adoring of it: On the contrary, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent them unto us in a poſture which doth not well agree with an act of Adoration; for they were almoſt lying along upon their ſides, on little Beds round the Table, according to the manner of that time. Moreover, if Jeſus Chriſt had commanded his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to adore what he gave them in the diſtribution of his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and if the Diſciples had indeed adored it, it is very
<pb n="564" facs="tcp:47504:285"/>likely, ſay ſome, that the Rulers of the Jews would have known it by <hi>Judas;</hi> and knowing it, they would not have failed to have urged it as a capital Crime againſt Jeſus Chriſt: for as they ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only ſome ſpecious pretext to condemn him, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have failed embracing this, which was very plauſible, and would have accuſed our Saviour of having adored Bread and Wine; and the rather becauſe amongſt them, worſhipping of Creatures was held for an unpardonable crime; at leaſt, after their return from the <hi>Babylonian</hi> Captivity.</p>
                  <p>But beſides what hath been ſaid, the diſorder of the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, affords us, ſay they, a convincing Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of the ſame thing. This divine Apoſtle condemns the <hi>Corinthians</hi> irreverence in the celebration of this auguſt Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: he endeavours to make them aſhamed of it, and to ſhew them, that their Conduct in this occaſion was quite contrary both unto the working of Charity, and the rules of holy Diſcipline, ſuch as the Diſcipline amongſt Chriſtians ſhould be; yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, to return them unto their duty, and to perſuade and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire them with the reſpect due unto ſo great a Sacrament, he doth not ſay a word unto them of its Adoration, the conſideration whereof had been of very great moment, and capable of produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing in the Spirits of theſe diſorderly Chriſtians, other thoughts than thoſe which they ſhewed at the time which they were to participate of this divine Myſtery.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Luke,</hi> in the <hi>Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> which contains the Hiſtory of the Infant Church, doth obſerve ſeveral times, that Believers aſſembled to break Bread; that is to ſay, to celebrate the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt; but he never ſaid that the Sacrament was to be adored.</p>
                  <p>But it may be that the Chriſtians which immediately followed the Age of the Apoſtles, had upon this Subject other diſcoveries than thoſe which the Scriptures inform us of; and that they can inform us of things we know nothing of. St. <hi>Juſtin Martyr,</hi> which flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about fifty years after the death of St. <hi>John,</hi> doth in his ſecond Apology exactly and amply deſcribe the whole action of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and all that was therein practiſed in his time, on the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of him which celebrated, and alſo on their parts which did communicate; the Oblation of Bread, Wine and Water, which was preſented unto the Paſtor when Sermon and Prayers were ended; the Conſecration which was performed by him, by Prayers and Thankſgivings unto God; the <hi>Amen,</hi> which was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by Believers; the diſtribution and communicating of the things which had been bleſſed and conſecrated; and in fine, the Charities and Alms-deeds made by particular perſons, and which was as the Crown and Seal of all this holy Action. But in all
<pb n="565" facs="tcp:47504:285"/>this deſcription we do ſee no mark of the Worſhip of <hi>Latry,</hi> nor of any religious Worſhip, either commanded by the Paſtors, or practiſed by the People towards the Sacrament, although that this glorious Martyr had twice treated of the Sacrament in this Apology; as hath been declared in our firſt part. And this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation which St. <hi>Juſtin</hi> gives unto us of the Euchariſt in his time, I mean, of the Celebration of this Sacrament, anſwers not ill unto what himſelf obſerved in his Dialogue againſt <hi>Tryphon; That Chriſtians in all places made the Euchariſt of Bread and Wine,</hi> and yet never ſpeaks of adoring it; and unto the ſilence of other Authors of his, and the following Age; becauſe in all their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings they are ſilent upon this matter, although it be of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt moment in Religion. I ſpeak of St. <hi>Ireneus,</hi> of <hi>Clemens</hi> of <hi>Alexandria, Tertullian,</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and of <hi>Origen;</hi> who, very far from enjoyning this Adoration, give not the leaſt appearance to imagine that it was practiſed, neither in the paſſages where they ſpeak of the Euchariſt, nor in others where they ſeem to be indiſpenſably obliged to ſay ſomething of it. As for example, <hi>Tertullian</hi> in his Apologetick, where he promiſeth to diſcover,
<note place="margin">Cap. 39.</note> and to demonſtrate what doth concern Chriſtian Religion; and where he makes ſo excellent and rich a deſcription of the <hi>Agapes,</hi> and of the Aſſemblies of thoſe primitive Chriſtians; he ſaith on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<note place="margin">Ep. 10, 11, 12, 13.</note> 
                     <hi>That they do there eat as perſons which remember that they are ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to ſerve God all night.</hi> And St. <hi>Cyprian,</hi> treating of thoſe which had fallen in the time of Perſecution, and being aſſiſted by the Recommendations of Martyrs, would needs communicate be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they had accompliſhed the time of their Penance, doth all he can to exaggerate the crime of theſe over-haſty perſons, and to juſtifie his ſeverity and his rigour; yet nevertheleſs, he doth not touch, far or near, the point of Adoration; which however, would have vindicated the juſtice of his Conduct, and the teme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of thoſe inſolent perſons. But beſides, we are ſo far from finding any thing in the Writings of theſe ancient Doctors above<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named, that doth in the leaſt favour the Adoration which we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine, that on the contrary, they therein deliver certain things which have been already cited elſewhere, as do abſolutely alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate from the Spirit of Communicants all thoughts of Adoration. as when St. <hi>Ireneus</hi> repreſents the Oblation of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by an Oblation of Bread and Wine, of the firſt Gifts of God which gives us Food of the firſt of his Creatures. <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria; That what Jeſus Chriſt gave his Diſciples to drink was Wine; that the Euchariſt is divided into ſeveral parts, that each Communicant takes a part, and that one eats ſufficiently of the Bread of the Lord.</hi> Tertullian; <hi>That the Euchariſt is a figure of the Body
<pb n="566" facs="tcp:47504:286"/>of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> St. <hi>Cyprian; That what our Saviour did call his Blood, was Wine.</hi> And <hi>Origen; that the Euchariſt is Bread in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; that according unto what it hath of matter, it deſcends into the Belly, and from thence into the place of Excrements.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Adoration now in queſtion doth not appear in the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies which go under the names of St. <hi>Peter,</hi> St. <hi>James,</hi> and St. <hi>Mark,</hi> nor in that which is in the Book of the Apoſtolical Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, nor in the Writings of the pretended <hi>Dennis</hi> the <hi>Arco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagite,</hi> which hath treated expreſly of the Celebration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament. It muſt be confeſſed that it is a wonderful thing if this religious Adoration had been in uſe, that neither one nor another ſhould ſay any thing of it, the action being of moment ſufficient not to be forgotten in ſuch ample and exact deſcriptions, as thoſe be which are contained in theſe Liturgies; for as for that Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrophe which is read in the Liturgy of the forged <hi>Dennis</hi> the <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copagite,

                  </p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and St.
<note place="margin">Catech. Myſt. 5 Serm. 83. de diverſ.</note> 
                     <hi>Auſtin</hi> have been careful very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to explain unto their <hi>Neophites,</hi> or new Baptized, the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal things which were practiſed in this divine Service. And they obſerve, that after Conſecration of the <hi>Symbols,</hi> the Lord's Prayer was ſaid, and the Prieſt cried, <hi>Sancta ſanctis, Holy things be for the Holy:</hi> the Believers gave unto each other the Kiſs of Peace; and they were invited unto the Communion by theſe words which were ſung, <hi>Taſte and ſee how good the Lord is. As ſoon as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration is ended</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Auſtin</hi>) <hi>we ſay the Lord's Prayer, which you have learned and ſaid: after this Prayer, is ſaid,</hi> Peace be with you; <hi>and Chriſtians give each other the holy Kiſs.</hi> They were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo told of <hi>Surſum Corda, Lift up your hearts;</hi> of <hi>Gracias agamus Domino Deo noſtro, Let us give thanks unto the Lord our God:</hi> and of <hi>the waſhing of hands:</hi> but amongſt all theſe Inſtructions, I do not find any one touching the Adoration of the Sacrament. It is true, St. <hi>Cyril</hi> will have his Communicant approach unto the holy Table, not with hands ſtretched out, nor his fingers open; but in ſupporting the right hand with the left, that he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Body of Jeſus Chriſt in the hollow of his hand; or, as he ſpeaks ſome lines before, <hi>The Antitype of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt;</hi> that he take care that not a crumb of it fall to the ground: and having in this manner communicated of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, he ſhould approach unto the Cup, having the Body bowed in way of Adoration, or Veneration. But beſides, ſay ſome, St. <hi>Cyril</hi> doth not deſire of his Communicant this inclination of body for
<pb n="568" facs="tcp:47504:287"/>Reception of the other Symbol which he repreſents unto us, and doth call it the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, ſuch as ſome crumbs where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of may fall to the ground: it is that the Cup, unto which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires he ſhould draw near with this inclination of Body, contains a Liquor, <hi>the moiſture of which, and the humidity remains,</hi> as he ſaith, <hi>upon the lips:</hi> which cannot be ſaid of the proper Blood of the Son of God. The poſture then which he preſcribes for receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Cup muſt neceſſarily be underſtood, not of an act of Adoration, which he doth not teach, in any part of his Catechiſms, unto his <hi>Neophites;</hi> but according to our ſecond Conſideration, of the Veneration and reſpect which we ought to have for ſo great a Sacrament; the Greek word uſed by St. <hi>Cyril</hi> being to be underſtood by that of veneration and reſpect, becauſe he ſpeaks of an Object which is not adorable with the Adoration of <hi>Late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> that is to ſay, of the Sacrament: and that beſides, he would not have ſaid barely, <hi>Approach with a little bowing the body;</hi> but he would preciſely have commanded to have adored it before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving of it; this action being of too great moment to ſpeak ſo indifferently of, and not to have commanded it after a more exact manner. I will ad unto all theſe reaſons, that St. <hi>Cyril</hi> requires nothing of his Communicants but what what St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> doth require of his alſo, and yet in ſtronger terms of his Catechumeny, when the time of their Catechiſing was expired, that they preſented themſelves to be baptized;
<note place="margin">In illud ſimile eſt regnum coelor. patrifa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mil. t. 6. p. 550.</note> 
                     <hi>When you ſhall</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>come into the Cloſet of the holy Spirit, when you ſhall run into the Marriage-Chamber of Grace, when you ſhall be near unto that terrible and alſo deſirable Pool, proſtrate your ſelves as Captives before your King, caſt your ſelves all together on your knees; and lifting up your hands unto Heaven, where the King of us all is ſitting on his Royal Throne; and lifting up your eyes unto that Eye which never ſlumbers, uſe theſe words unto that Lover of Mankind,</hi> &amp;c. Is not this approaching unto Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptiſm in a way of Worſhip and Adoration, as St. <hi>Cyril</hi> deſired one ſhould approach unto the holy Communion? And yet Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians never inferred from the words of St. <hi>Chryſoſtom,</hi> that the Water of this Sacrament of our Regeneration was to be adored. But what I ſay of the water of Baptiſm, the ſame <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires we ſhould alſo do of the hearing of the Word of God; <hi>The King himſelf</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>will not have his Diadem upon his head,
<note place="margin">In illud ne e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leemoſ. veſtr. ſac. t. 6. p. 528.</note> but lays it aſide, in reverence unto God ſpeaking in the holy Goſpel. What, (ſaith he) I know his Dignity, which hath given me mine: I adore his Kingdom, which hath been pleaſed to make me reign.</hi> And to ſay the truth, we owe the ſame reſpect and veneration unto the Word of God, and to his Sacraments, which we do owe unto him which is the Author of them, by giving him the Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raign
<pb n="569" facs="tcp:47504:287"/>Adoration which we are obliged to render him at all times, eſpecially when we hear his Word read and preached, and when we participate of his divine Sacraments.</p>
                  <p>If we deſcend yet lower than St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> we may inform our ſelves of what hath been practiſed in the Church ſince his death, upon the Subject of the Adoration of the Sacrament; for we have in the Works of St. <hi>Ambroſe,</hi> two Treatiſes touching the ſame matter, made in the behalf of thoſe newly initiated; of which, the latter, entituled, <hi>Of the Sacraments,</hi> is more ample than the other. We have that of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Offices,</hi> compoſed by St. <hi>Iſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Sevil;</hi> the Book of Sacraments of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Firſt; that made by <hi>Maximius,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounding very myſtically all the Action of the Sacrament. <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> Patriarch of the ſame place, alſo employed himſelf upon the ſame Subject; and hath at large all that long Hiſtory of Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies practiſed in an Age which had already departed very much from the ſimplicity of the primitive times. The Book, called <hi>The Roman Order,</hi> doth alſo examine all the particulars of the publick Service practiced in the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> We have in the IX. Century the Treatiſe of <hi>Rabanus,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Mayans,</hi> of the Inſtitution of Clerks; that of <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Offices</hi> of <hi>Amalarius Fortunatus;</hi> that of <hi>Walfridus Strabo,</hi> almoſt under the ſame Title; that of <hi>Florus,</hi> under the name of <hi>Explication of the Maſs.</hi> In fine, we have ſeveral other Treatiſes of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and order that ought to be obſerved in the Celebration of the Maſs, or of the Euchariſt, which <hi>Hugh Mainard,</hi> a learned <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictine,</hi> hath cauſed to be printed with the Books of Sacraments of <hi>Gregory</hi> the Great; as that he took from the Manuſcript of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Corby,</hi> about the Year 986. Another from the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary of <hi>du Tillet,</hi> and which he ſaith, is the Roman Order of the Year 1032. and a third of the Priory of <hi>Saluſe</hi> in <hi>Normandy,</hi> of the Prebends of the Order of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> about the Year 1079. But in all this we do not find one word of the Adoration of the Sacrament, no more than the Interpreters and Commentators of the Hiſtory of the Inſtitution of it; which are not a few.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, the expreſſions of the ancient Doctors of the Church will not a little contribute unto the illuſtrating of this matter; for if they had a deſign to have Chriſtians worſhip the Sacrament before receiving of it, or at the inſtant of communicating, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks they ſhould have ſpoke in a manner and way which ſhould have poſſeſſed them with thoughts and diſpoſitions ſuitable, and which ſhould have made them to conceive of it the ſame Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion which one hath for an Object which is truly adorable. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, inſtead of ſo doing, I find their Inſtructions tended
<pb n="570" facs="tcp:47504:288"/>rather to divert, than to incline them unto this Homage. In fine, I cannot comprehend that the people could diſpoſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves unto the Adoration of the Euchariſt, when they heard the holy Fathers unanimouſly call it Bread and Wine, even in the very act of Communion. <hi>Wheat, the Fruit of the Vine, the Fruit of the Harveſt,</hi> and the like things. They teſtifie it is Bread which is broke, poſitively affirm that it is Bread and Wine; Bread which nouriſheth our Bodies, which is inanimate, which is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, the ſubſtance whereof remains after Conſecration: in a word, Bread, ſubject unto the ſame accidents with our common food. For theſe are ſo many formal Declarations which theſe holy Doctors have made unto us in the ſecond Chapter of the ſecond Part. Muſt it not be confeſſed that they very ill inſtructed the people which God had committed unto their charge, if the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is a Subject to be adored, becauſe all theſe plain and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal expreſſions ſerved only to eſtrange the Mind from the Idea of this Soveraign Worſhip of Religion, in making them conclude it was nothing but Bread and Wine in regard of their nature, but otherwiſe the Sacraments of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. And what confirmed them the more in this thought is, that the Fathers never warned them to take their words figuratively, when they ſay that the Euchariſt is Bread and Wine; but when they call it the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, they uſe many precautions, as hath been ſhewed in the third Chapter, ſaying, that almoſt all do call the Sacrament his Body; that our Saviour hath honoured the Symbols with the names of his Body and Blood, that they be his Body and Blood, not ſimply and abſolutely; but after ſome ſort being ſo called by reaſon of the reſemblance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they be the Sacraments, the Signs, the Figures, the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morials of his Perſon and Death, and that they are in the ſtead of his Body and Blood. What need all theſe Limitations and Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations, if their deſign had been that the people ſhould have ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Euchariſt; for you would ſay, that they ſeem to be afraid that they ſhould take it for an Object worthy of this Worſhip and Homage, ſo much care is taken by them, to make them compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend what ſenſe they ſhould give unto their words, when they ſay that it is the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, a precaution abſolutely inconſiſtent with the intention and thought of inſpiring unto them the Doctrine of Adoration. This is the reaſoning of thoſe which admit not of the Adoration of the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>But if from the conſideration of the words of the holy Fathers, we paſs unto that of ſeveral things which were practiſed by the ancient Church in regard of the holy Sacrament, and which hath been examined by us in the firſt Part, we may draw Inferences,
<pb n="571" facs="tcp:47504:288"/>by the help whereof we ſhall the eaſier diſcover the truth of what we do examine. For example, the Chriſtians for ſeveral Ages, made uſe of Glaſs Chalices in the Celebration of the Sacrament: They gave the Sacrament for a long time unto young Children, although very uncapable of the act of Adoration. They obliged Communicants to receive it in their hands; they permitted them to carry it home along with them unto their houſes, and to keep it as long as they pleaſed, even to carry it along with them in their Travels, without ever finding that they gave it any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Worſhip whilſt they kept it locked in their Cheſts or Cloſets. They ſent it unto the Abſent, and unto the Sick, without any Ceremony; not only by Prieſts and Deacons, but even by Lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſons; by Men, Women, and young Boys. Biſhops, for above three Centuries, ſent it unto each other in token of Love and Communion, without any noiſe, or giving it any homage or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by the way, and without the peoples aſſembling in the ways by which it paſſed, to receive it, as an Object of their Service and Adoration. They alſo ſometimes communicated, without any ſcruple of Conſcience, after Dinner or Supper; and ſo mingled the Euchariſt with their other food. Were not this to anſwer very ill unto the ſoveraign reſpect which one ſhould have for a Divinity one adores, to mingle it in the ſame Stomach with ordinary food, and to communicate ſtanding, as they did.</p>
                  <p>But beſides all theſe Cuſtoms obſerved in the Ancient Church, ſee here others alſo obſerved by them, and which have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by us in treating of the exteriour form of Celebration: In ſome places what was left of the Euchariſt after Conſecration, was burnt in the Fire; in other places it was eaten by little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, which were ſent for from School. The Sacrament was employed to make Plaiſters; it was buried with the Dead; and ſometimes, Ink was mingled with the Conſecrated Wine; and then they dipt their Pens in theſe two mixed Liquors. Can it be imagined, ſay the Proteſtants, that Chriſtians ſo zealous as they were, ſhould Adore the Sacrament, ſeeing it was employed by them unto uſes ſo far diſtant from this Adoration, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary unto the Worſhip which is due unto God: All theſe Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoms, could they conſiſt with a Worſhip of this Nature, and with this Soveraign reſpect which is due only unto the ſole object of our Devotion, and of our Religion, let the Reader judge. And the better to judge hereof, let him compare the conduct of the Ancient Church, in this particular, with that of the Latin Church ſince the XI. Century; for theſe kinds of oppoſitions do not a little contribute unto the Illuſtrating the matters now in queſtion; practices ſo different upon the ſame ſubject, not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding
<pb n="572" facs="tcp:47504:289"/>but from divers principles; nor ſuch various effects, but from as different cauſes. I ought not to paſs in ſilence the cuſtom of this ſame Church, in turning out of the Aſſembly all thoſe that could not or would not Communicate; I ſpeak of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumeny, the Energumeny, and the Penitents; which could not be admitted unto the participation of this Divine Sacrament: and of thoſe amongſt Believers which voluntarily deprived them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of it; for it is moſt certain, that all thoſe which remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Aſſembly did communicate, both great and ſmall, as hath been ſhewed in the firſt Part of this Book: And neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, if beſides the uſe of the Communion, for which they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the Euchariſt had been inſtituted, they believed that the Sacrament was an object of Adoration. What did they mean in forbidding thoſe People which were not in a ſtate of communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the acts of Piety and Chriſtian Humility: A thing ſo much the more ſtrange, that the Holy Fathers believed for certain, that prayers made unto God at the time of celebrating the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were more efficacious, then thoſe made unto him at other times, by reaſon of the Commemoration which is there made of the Death of Jeſus Chriſt; in whoſe Name, and for whoſe Merits, we pray unto him. By what principle and motive were they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the fruit and comfort which they might receive from the homage which they would have given unto God at that bleſſed moment? The ſinner addreſſing himſelf unto the object of this Worſhip and Adoration, I mean unto the Sacrament, would have prayed unto it with a flood of tears, and with ſincere marks of his Repentance and Contrition, to grant him pardon of his ſins, and to ſeal the Abſolution of them unto his Soul. The Energumeny would have implored the aſſiſtance of his holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit for his deliverance from the ſlavery of the Devil. The Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>techumeny would have preſented unto him his prayers for the aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of his knowledge, and to be e're long honoured by being Baptized into his Church; and then afterwards to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted unto the holy Sacrament. And in fine, the Believer in the ſenſe of his unworthineſs, would have proſtrated himſelf in its preſence, and would have ardently prayed unto it to beſtow upon him better diſpoſitions, in approaching another time unto the myſtical Table, there to receive the pledges of his conſolati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and ſalvation. Is it probable, ſay ſome, if theſe Chriſtians had held the Euchariſt for an Object deſerving the higheſt Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that they would have uſed ſo ſevere and rigorous a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline, which no way ſavoured of the meekneſs and love of Jeſus Chriſt, againſt theſe ſeveral ſorts of People? Is it not more likely that they would have endeavoured to have comforted
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:47504:289"/>them, in repreſenting, that if they were debarr'd for ſome time, from the participation of this great Sacrament, that yet they had the comfort of adoring it, and of rendring it their homage, and the acts of their Piety and Devotion, in an occaſion wherein God ſhewed himſelf more propitious unto men; and wherein he anſwers more favourably unto their prayers and deſires. But they were fo far from doing ſo, that they turn'd them out with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any pity, at the time they were to celebrate this Divine Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament; from whence the Proteſtants infer, That they did not look upon it as an object of Adoration.</p>
                  <p>But as they argued againſt the Adoration of the Sacrament upon what was done by the Primitive Chriſtians, ſo do they alſo argue againſt it by what they did not do, and yet that which is very religiouſly practiſed by the Latins; for the Latins do not fail to expoſe and ſhew the holy Sacrament in publick rejoycings or calamities: they adore and invoke it, when they undertake any thing which is conſiderable, and the execution whereof ſeems difficult. They cauſe it to be adored by their new Converts, and by their Penitents; by the former, that they ſhould give it thanks for their ſpiritual regeneration; and by the others, to make atonement for their ſins in its preſence. They make little Images of it, and do conſecrate them: they addreſs unto it their Vows, their Prayers, and their Thankſgivings; but in the Ancient Chriſtian Church nothing of all this was ſeen, neither any Miracle of the Hoſt being Worſhipped by Beaſts, as is rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in ſome Writers of the Latin Church, to have frequently happened, which confirms them the more in the belief they have, that for more then ten Ages, the Church did not Worſhip the Euchariſt. Whereunto they alſo add, that the Primitive Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians neither cauſed Incenſe nor Candles in day time, to be burnt unto it, as we have ſhewed in the Chapter wherein we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to diſcover the beginning of theſe two Cuſtoms, which is attended with a third, amongſt the Latins, I mean that of Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, which are uſed either in a way of Garlands, or otherways, unto the honour of the Sacrament, particularly the day called the Holy, or the Feaſt of God; and nevertheleſs, <hi>Athenagoras</hi> doth include under the ſame condemnation, the uſe of Incenſe,
<note place="margin">Leg. pro Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian.</note> of Odours and Flowers in the Service of God: <hi>The Creator</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>and the Father of all things, hath no want of Blood, of Fat, of Flowers, nor of odoriferous Perfumes, becauſe he needeth nothing, and is himſelf a very ſweet Odour, and deſireth nothing out of himſelf; and that the greateſt Sacrifice which he requireth, is, That we ſhould know him.</hi> In the Dialogue of <hi>Minutius Foelix,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pag. 10. ult. ed.</note> the Pagan <hi>Cecilius</hi> reproacheth ours, <hi>That they do not Crown their Heads
<pb n="574" facs="tcp:47504:290"/>with Flowers, and that they perfume not their Bodies with Odours.</hi> Which <hi>Octavius,</hi> the Advocate for the Chriſtians, doth not deny; and he only replies, That Chriſtians do not diſallow the uſe of Flowers,
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 30.</note> yet it is in ſuch a way, as that they do not wear them upon their Heads. <hi>Pardon us,</hi> ſaith he pleaſantly, <hi>if we Crown not our Heads with Flowers; we are wont to ſmell the Odour of them with the noſe, and not with the hinder part of the head, nor with the hair.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pedag. l. 2. c. 8. p. 179.</note> It is whereunto amounts alſo what is ſaid by <hi>Clement</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> when he condemns <hi>the uſe of Flowers, as fit only for Banquets, and for Debauchery;</hi> alledging, even preſently after, theſe two or three words; <hi>Adorn not my head with a Crown.</hi> He is content we ſhould enjoy the ſweet ſmell of Flowers,
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 180.</note> which are ſo plentiful in the Fields; But to make a Crown of them, to put them on the head,
<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> and to wear them as an Ornament about or in the houſe,
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 181.</note> he cannot ſuffer it; ſaying, <hi>That doth not become a wiſe and ſober perſon.</hi> He adds, <hi>That thoſe which be crowned with Flowers do neither enjoy the beauty of them by the eyes, nor the ſcent of them by the noſe, although that is their true and natural uſe.</hi> He obſerves that it was but of late that the Luxury of the Greeks had invented this uſe of Crowns of Flowers;
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 182.</note> from whence he concludes, <hi>That the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould abſtain from them, becauſe they are conſecrated unto Idols; that they ought not to be uſed for Conſcience ſake, and that the lively Image of God ſhould not be crowned as dead Idols are crowned.</hi> He ſaith moreover, <hi>That it is not at all reaſonable, that thoſe who have been taught that our Saviour was crowned with Thorns, ſhould have their heads crowned with Flowers;
<note place="margin">Ibid. p. 183.</note> by deriſion to inſult over his venerable Paſſion.</hi> In fine, he obſerves, <hi>That if in matter of Flowers, ſomething ſhould be granted unto pleaſure and civil Recreation, Chriſtians ſhould ſatisfie them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with the ſmell of Flowers; but that they are not permitted to be crowned with them. Tertullian</hi> is no leſs expreſs than the reſt, nor no leſs ſevere in condemning theſe ſorts of Crowns; for anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the reproach made againſt Chriſtians, of not bringing any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit unto the Trade of the World, and of the fault which was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted unto them for not uſing Flowers,
<note place="margin">Apolog c. 42.</note> ſee here what he ſaith; <hi>I buy no Flowers to make a Crown to go round my head: What need you care what uſe it is that I make of the Flowers that I ſhall buy in the Market? I fancy they are better when they are looſe, unbound and ſeveral, without any order, than to have them made up like a Crown: when they are in that condition, we are wont to put them unto the noſe, and to ſmell them. Let them which wear them on their heads conſider which is propereſt: to ſmell them by the hair, or by the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan of ſmelling.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Id. de Cor. c. 2.</note> And elſewhere he propoſeth the practice of all Chriſtians; <hi>Not one of which</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>wears a Crown on their

<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> but laying aſide the fear of danger, there was not one that did not reject the uſe of wearing Crowns on the head: <hi>All Chriſtians</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>did practiſe ſo;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>did wear no Crowns of Flowers upon their heads; from the Catechumeny, unto the Confeſſors and Martyrs;

<note place="margin">Ibid. c. 9.</note> but that amongſt Chriſtians it alſo deſerves the Title of Sacrilege againſt God, the Author and Governor of Nature.</hi> And a little after, <hi>What Patriarch,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>what Prophet hath been ever heard to be crowned?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ibid.</note> He concludes preciſely, <hi>That the Servants of God ſhould not be crowned; and that Chriſtians are not permitted to wear any other Crown, but a Crown of Thorns, after the example of Jeſus Chriſt.

<note place="margin">Ibid.</note> that Jeſus Chriſt was crowned, you may be anſwered in a few words; that you are permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to be crowned alſo after the ſame manner.</hi> In fine, having con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed that Idols, and the Dead,

Secondly, That Garlands and Crowns of Flowers made in honour of the Sacrament, was not in uſe; and that there were no Prieſts ſeen crowned with Flowers when they celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this Myſtery, as is to be ſeen amongſt the Latins on the day of the Feaſt of God, when the Hoſt is carried in ſolemn Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.
<note place="margin">Orat. 2. in Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. quae eſt. 4.</note> I know not how <hi>Gregory Nazianzen</hi> could abſolutely have forbidden Chriſtians of ſtrewing the Street with Flowers at the Celebration of their Holy Days, had the uſe of Flowers already been introduced into the Worſhip of their Religion, without tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling them that it was ſufficient to employ them in the Aſſemblies, unto the honour of the Euchariſt;
<note place="margin">Serm. 2. de Pentecoſt.</note> and whether St. <hi>Chryſoſtom</hi> would have addreſſed this Exhortation unto his Auditors on a day of <hi>Pentecoſt; I conjure you by the conſideration of all the benefits
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:47504:291"/>ſo liberally beſtowed upon us this day, that we alſo celebrate the Feaſt, not in crowning our doors, but in preparing our Souls, and in ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring them beautiful with the Ornaments of vertue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But beſides all that we have hitherto obſerved on the Subject of the Adoration of the Sacrament, there be others which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a particular Conſideration; As the Elevation to excite the people unto the Adoration of the conſecrated Hoſt; the Sound of the Bell to give warning to the people of it. As alſo the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Day, and Proceſſion of the Sacrament. As touching the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, we have treated amply thereof in the ninth Chapter of the firſt Part; where we have ſhewed that the Elevation, whoſe ſcope is the Adoration of the Sacrament, was never at all practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the Latin Church before the XIII. Century: So that the Reader may look back upon what hath been ſaid in that Chapter, without being at the trouble of repeating it over again in this place. It ſhall ſuffice to relate the Conſtitutions which the Popes made about that time, to incline the people unto the Adoration of the Hoſt. The firſt is, that of <hi>Honorius</hi> the Third, who was Pope in the Year of our Lord, 1216. which is conceived in theſe terms; <hi>That Prieſts ſhould often teach their people, that at the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebration of Maſs, when the Hoſt is lifted up, they ſhould kneel with reſpect; and that they ſhould alſo do the like when the Prieſt carries it unto any ſick perſon. Gregory</hi> the Ninth, which ſucceeded him, <hi>Anno</hi> 1227. invented the ringing a Bell, to warn the people to fall down on their knees to adore the conſecrated Hoſt;

Century, did condemn thoſe which taught, <hi rend="sup">3</hi> 
                     <hi>That when the Body of Jeſus Chriſt was lifted up, men need not ſtir, nor give unto it any homage.</hi> He ſpeaks of the Sacrament, the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration whereof was not approved by thoſe perſons. From thence it is alſo that in the Breviary, the Prieſt who ſays Maſs, is ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſely warned to kneel down and worſhip the Hoſt after pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing theſe words, <hi>This is my Body;</hi> and to ſhew it unto the people, that they alſo might worſhip it:
<note place="margin">In Miſſali O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. ante Miſſ. ſignat. f. 1111.</note> and alſo doth reiterate the ſame Warning as touching the Cup. From thence (in fine) proceeds the Prayers which be addreſſed unto the Sacrament; <hi>I devoutly adore thee, O hidden Divinity, who art truly vailed under theſe Types: I whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubmit my heart unto thee, becauſe it faileth in my meditating of thee: My Sight, Touch, and Taſte are deceived in regard of thee; and it is in the hearing only that any confidence can be laid. I believe all that the Son of God hath ſaid, and there is nothing truer than this
<pb n="577" facs="tcp:47504:291"/>Word of Truth. The Divinity only was hid upon the Croſs, but here the Humanity is alſo vailed, Nevertheleſs, in believing and confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing both the one and the other, I beg of thee what the penitent Thief deſired. I do not ſee thy Wounds, as did St.</hi> Thomas; <hi>however, I confeſs thou art my God. Enable me to believe always in thee, to put all my truſt and confidence in thee, and to love thee. O Memorial of the death of our Saviour; Bread of Life, which giveſt Life unto Mankind, grant that my Soul may live on thee, and that it may always find delight and ſweetneſs in thee. O divine Pellican, Jeſus my Lord, I am unclean: waſh me, and cleanſe me with thy Blood; one drop whereof is ſufficient to ſave the whole World from all Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. O Jeſus, whom I now behold vailed; I beſeech thee that thou wilt be pleaſed to grant what I ſo earneſtly beg;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>that behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee with open face, I may become happy by the ſight of thy Glory.</hi> And this other, <hi>I ſalute thee, Light of the World,

                  </p>
                  <p>It muſt not be forgot that juſt at the beginning of the XIII. Century, a few years before <hi>Honorius</hi> the Third had made his Conſtitution for the Adoration of the Sacrament; <hi>Odo,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris</hi> ordained,
<note place="margin">Statut Synod. c. 5. t. 6. Bibl. Pat.</note> 
                     <hi>That the people ſhould often be exhorted to bow the knee before the Body, as before their Maker and Lord, as often as they ſhould ſee it paſs before them.</hi> This Prelate cauſed ſeveral pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions to be added unto this Decree, in caſe it ſhould happen that any part of the Body and Blood of Jeſus Chriſt ſhould fall to the ground, or that any Fly or Spider ſhould chance to fall into the Blood. 'Tis true, <hi>Odo</hi> was not the firſt that preſcribed theſe kinds of precautions; for from the VIII. Century, ſomewhat of this nature is to be ſeen in a Penitential, attributed unto Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the XIII. which held the Chair, according unto <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi>'s computation, from the Year 731. unto the Year 741. I ſay, this Penitential is attributed unto him; for it is not very certain that it is his: but in fine, it is in this Book, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted in one of the Tomes of the Councils,
<note place="margin">Tom. 5. p. 471.</note> that Precautions like unto thoſe eſtabliſhed by <hi>Odo,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> are to be ſeen. And it is, as I conceive, of this Penitential Book,
<note place="margin">De Conſecr. diſtinct. 2. c. ſi per negligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam.</note> attributed unto <hi>Gregory</hi> the Thirteenth, that the Canoniſt <hi>Gratian</hi> hath taken the words he cites in his Decrete, under the name of Pope <hi>Pius</hi> the firſt, who lived about the middle of the II. Century. In fine, beſides that they agree much better with the time of <hi>Grego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry,</hi> than with that of <hi>Pius,</hi> who as yet was ignorant of theſe kinds of Precautions. The words related by <hi>Gratian,</hi> as ſpoken by <hi>Pius,</hi> are at this day to be found <hi>verbatim,</hi> in the Penitential, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven us under the name of <hi>Gregory</hi> the XIII. The firſt Chriſtians were careful that no part of the ſacred Symbols of the Euchariſt
<pb n="578" facs="tcp:47504:292"/>ſhould fall to the ground; but we do not find that they made any Ordinance touching what might, through neglect, fall to the ground, of the Bread and Wine of the Sacrament: that was an effect of after Ages; which being in proceſs of time become infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more ſcrupulous than former Chriſtians, became alſo more liberal of their Decrees and Conſtitutions, eſpecially in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned the Sacrament of the Euchariſt: inſomuch that <hi>Hubert,</hi> Arch-Biſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and Legat of Pope <hi>Celeſtine,</hi> made this Decree at the end of the XII. Century, never regarding the ſimplicity with which the Sacrament was ſent unto ſick people in the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity;
<note place="margin">Apud Roger. de Hoveden in Richard. I.</note> 
                     <hi>That Prieſts, as often as there is need to communicate the Sick, ſhould themſelves carry the Hoſt in their Prieſtly Habits, ſuitable unto ſo great a Sacrament: and that Lights ſhould be carried before it, if ſtormy Weather, the badneſs of the Ways, or ſome other reaſon doth not hinder. Odo,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Paris,</hi> did moreover ordain, <hi>That all perſons ſhould kneel down unto it when it paſſed by;</hi> which, if my Memory fail not, is the firſt Decree made for adoring the Hoſt; yet it muſt not be imagined that the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Sacrament was not at all practiſed in the Latin Church before this Ordinance of <hi>Odo,</hi> which was made in the beginning of the XIII. Century. There be ſome which think that it was eſtabliſhed by <hi>Durandus,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Troarn,</hi> in the XI. Century, a little after <hi>Berengarius</hi> had declared himſelf againſt the Doſtrine of the Real Preſence. But if <hi>Durandus</hi> made no mention of the Adoration of the Sacrament, as in effect there be thoſe which refer his words unto the bleſſed Humanity of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, whereof he maketh mention in the ſame place, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which they pretend that the act of Adoration ſhould be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, according to the deſign of this Abbot; it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied but <hi>Alger</hi> formally taught it in the XII. Century:
<note place="margin">De Sacram. l. 2. c. 3.</note> for as to what we read in the ancient Cuſtoms of the Monaſtery of <hi>Cluny, That all thoſe which meet the Prieſt,
<note place="margin">Lib. 3. c. 18. t. 4. Spicil. p. 217.</note> bearing the Body of the Lord un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſick perſon ſhould demand Forgiveneſs;</hi> I do not ſee that all do explain this action after one manner. <hi>Dom Luke d'Achery,</hi> which cauſed them to be printed, underſtands it of Adoration; having cauſed this little Annotation to be put in the Margin; <hi>That is to ſay, that they ſhould proſtrate and adore.</hi> Others ſay that theſe words, <hi>Demand Pardon,</hi> do only ſignifie that thoſe which meet the Sacrament ſhould demand Forgiveneſs, either of the Prieſt, the ſame as in communicating;
<note place="margin">Ibid. l. 2. c. 30. p. 145.</note> for they all demanded Pardon of each other, and kiſſed the Prieſt's hand before they received the holy Sacrament; or of God, in conſideration of the death of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt,
<note place="margin">Ibid. l. 1. c. 13. p. 58. &amp;c. 38. p. 92.</note> whereof the Sacrament is a Memorial. Whereunto they add, that the ſame was practiſed in this famous Aſſembly,
<pb n="579" facs="tcp:47504:292"/>when the Croſs was uncovered on <hi>Good-Friday,</hi> and the day cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>The Exaltation of the Holy Croſs,</hi> and that the Pardon which they asked upon theſe two occaſions is diſtinguiſhed from Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Moreover they ſay, that in the thirtieth Chapter of the ſecond Book of theſe Cuſtoms, wherein is exactly repreſented what was practiſed in thoſe times in this famous Monaſtery, in the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration, and in the Communion of the Euchariſt, there is not one word ſaid of the Elevation of the Hoſt. Whence they infer, that they did not practiſe the Adoration of the Sacrament which in the Latin Church, for ſome Ages paſt, doth immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Elevation of it. After all, ſhould the words in queſtion be applied unto the Adoration of the Hoſt, no other conſequence could from thence be drawn but this, to wit, that in the XI. Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, at the end whereof, was collected together in three Books, all theſe ancient Cuſtoms, this Adoration began to be practiſed; that is to ſay, after the Condemnation of <hi>Berengarius,</hi> although there was no Decree for it until the XIII. Century.</p>
                  <p>And as before the XIII. Century, there was no Decree made touching the Adoration of the Sacrament, ſo alſo before that time there was no Holy Day dedicated unto its honour; from whence the Proteſtants do not fail to make their advantage againſt the Adoration of the Euchariſt; ſaying, That if this Adoration had been practiſed in the ancient Church, Chriſtians would not have referred it unto <hi>Urban</hi> the Fourth, the care of inſtituting the Feaſt of the Sacrament; which he did in the Year 1264. But it is not ſufficient to know that <hi>Urban</hi> the Fourth did inſtitute this Holy Day in that Year, if we do not alſo know that he was inclined thereunto by the deſires, and upon the Revelations of certain Women of the Country of <hi>Liege;</hi> particularly of a Nun called <hi>Eve,</hi> unto whom he wrote a Letter upon this Subject, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther unto all the Biſhops; the which is contained in the Bull of <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the Fifth, in the third Book of <hi>Clementines, tit.</hi> 16. as we are fully informed by <hi>John Dieſteim Blaerus,</hi> Prior of St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Leige,</hi> which he compoſed, after having made, as he ſaith, an exact enquiry of what had paſſed in this Inſtitution. And to inform the Reader of the nature of theſe Revelations, he adds, That the firſt of theſe Women, called <hi>Juliana,</hi> in praying, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a marvellous Aparition; <hi>viz. The Moon, as it were at Full, but having ſome kind of Spots:</hi> Whereupon ſhe was divinely inſpired that the Moon was the Church, and that the Spot which appeared therein was the want of a Holy Day, which as yet was wanting. So that ſhe received a Command from Heaven to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin this Solemnity, and to pubiſh unto the World that it ought to be celebrated. He ſaith moreover, That this <hi>Juliana</hi> having
<pb n="580" facs="tcp:47504:293"/>communicated her Revelations unto one <hi>Iſabella,</hi> this <hi>Iſabella,</hi> knowing the troubles <hi>Juliana</hi> was in upon this Subject, ſhe deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of God by earneſt Prayers, that he would impart unto her the knowledge of theſe things; and that going to viſit <hi>Eve,</hi> a Nun of the Church of St. <hi>Martins</hi> of <hi>Leige,</hi> ſhe no ſooner kneeled down before the Crucifix, but being raviſhed in mind, ſhe was ſhewed from Heaven, that this particular Holy Day of the Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chariſt had always been in the Council of the Soveraign Trinity, and that now the time of revealing it unto Men was come; for ſhe affirmed, that in her Extaſie, ſhe ſaw all the Heavenly Hoſt demand of God by their Prayers, that he would ſpeedily mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt this Solemnity unto the wavering World, to confirm the Faith of the Church Militant.</p>
                  <p>I am not ignorant but that there be ſome which would attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute the cauſe of this Inſtitution unto a Miracle of Blood, which, as they ſay, fell from an Hoſty in the hands of a Prieſt, as he ſang Maſs.</p>
                  <p>But Beſides what <hi>Dieſteim,</hi> and after him, ſeveral others have related unto us; we have, touching the firſt cauſe of this Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Declaration of <hi>Urban</hi> himſelf, which made it: For in the Letter which he wrote unto all the Biſhops, inſerted in the Bull of <hi>Clement</hi> the Fifth, he thus ſpeaks; <hi>We have underſtood heretofore, being in a lower Office</hi> (that is to ſay, when he was Arch-Deacon of the Church of <hi>Leige</hi>) <hi>that it was revealed unto ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholicks</hi> (which were the three Women mentioned by <hi>Dieſteim; Juliana, Iſabella,</hi> and <hi>Eve) that ſuch a Holy Day was to be generally celebrated in the Church.</hi> And in that which he wrote unto <hi>Eve; We are ſenſible, Daughter, that your Soul hath deſired with great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, that a ſolemn Holy Day of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted in the Church, to be celebrated by Believers unto perpetuity.</hi> This is the ground and foundation of this Feaſt, and the true cauſe of its Inſtitution, even according to the Teſtimony of the Life of <hi>Juliana,</hi> the firſt of theſe three Women; a Teſtimony whoſe proper terms is related by <hi>Molanus,</hi> in his Martyrology of Saints in <hi>Flanders,</hi> on the 5th of <hi>April.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But how great ſoever the Authority of Popes at that time was in the Weſt, the Decree of <hi>Urban</hi> was not obſerved in all Churches, by reaſon of the newneſs of the thing; therefore <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> the Fifth cauſed it to be publiſhed again about fifty years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the Gloſs upon the Decretal of <hi>Clement</hi> the Fifth, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in that of <hi>Urban</hi> is inſerted, expreſly obſerves. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, it was not hitherto kept as <hi>Dieſteim</hi> informs us, in the ninth Article of his Book; <q>Although <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolical Commands touching the Celebration of the new Holy
<pb n="581" facs="tcp:47504:293"/>Day of the venerable Sacrament hath been addreſſed unto all the Churches, yet ſo it is nevertheleſs, that none of the Churches were careful to give Obedience thereunto, excepting the Church of <hi>Leige;</hi> which, as ſoon as it had with honour received the Apoſtolical <hi>Nuncio,</hi> with the Bulls, the Decretals, and the Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice which he had brought; preſently, as a dutiful Daughter, gave Obedience thereunto; rejecting the Office which the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Juliana</hi> cauſed to be made, and uſing that which had been compoſed by <hi>Thomas Aquinas.</hi> And ſo ever ſince thoſe Bulls came, the Dioceſs of <hi>Liege,</hi> and no other elſe, hath ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed this Holy Day, until the days of our Lord, Pope <hi>John</hi> the Twenty ſecond, who lived in the Year of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, 1315. who publiſhed all the Conſtitutions of <hi>Clement,</hi> and ſent them unto the Univerſities.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now if it be demanded of <hi>Urban,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Clement. lib. 3 tit. 16. ſi Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minum.</note> what profit was made by this Inſtitution, he will anſwer, <q>That this Holy Day proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belongs unto the Sacrament, becauſe there is no Saint but hath its Holy Day, although there is remembrance had of them in the Maſſes, and in the Litanies. That it muſt be celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted once every year; particularly, to confound the Unbelief and Extravagance of Hereticks, to make a ſolemn and more particular Commemoration of it; to the end, to frequent Churches with more and greater Devotion; there to repair by attention, by humility of Spirit, and by purity of heart, all the defaults wherein we have fallen in all the other Maſſes, either by the diſquiet of worldly cares, or by the dulneſs and weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of humane frailty, and there with reſpect to receive this Sacrament, and to receive increaſe of Graces.</q> Almoſt the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame thing is to be ſeen in the Breviary of the Latin Church.</p>
                  <p>The Feaſt of the Sacrament was attended by Proceſſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Hoſt is born with Pomp and Magnificence. <hi>Dieſteim</hi> ſaith,
<note place="margin">Offic. fir. 6. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fra Oct. Corp. Chriſt. lect. 4. &amp; 5.</note> that it was Pope <hi>John</hi> the Twenty ſecond which introduced this cuſtom: But <hi>Boſſius</hi> in his Chronicles; and after him, <hi>Genebrard,</hi> in his Chronology, Book IV. place it much later; and ſay, that it began a hundred years after the Inſtitution of the Holy Day, to be practiſed at <hi>Pavia;</hi> from whence it ſpread it ſelf abroad into all the Weſtern Churches, and eſpecially at <hi>Angers,</hi> where <hi>Berengarius</hi> had been Arch-Deacon. Upon which, ſeveral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that this Inſtitution is directly contrary unto the practice of the ancient Church; that very far from carrying in Proceſſion the ſacred Symbols of the Body and Blood of our Saviour, did adminiſter them, the Doors ſhut, even from the III. Century; and concealed them not only from Unbelievers and Idolaters, but even alſo from the Catechumeny, which were made to go
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:47504:294"/>out when this divine Sacrament was to be adminiſtred. They add, that this Proceſſion was very ill reſented by many perſons that lived in the Communion of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. In fine, Queen <hi>Catherine de Medicis</hi> wrote unto the Pope in the Year 1561. as Monſieur <hi>de Thoul</hi> relates in his Hiſtory, to demand of him,
<note place="margin">Thuan. Hiſt. l. 28.</note> 
                     <q>That the Holy Day of the Body of Jeſus Chriſt, which had been newly invented, might be aboliſhed, becauſe it was the occaſion of many Scandals, and that it was no way neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for <hi>(ſaid ſhe)</hi> this Myſtery was inſtituted for a ſpiritual Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Adoration, and not for Pomp and Pageantry.</q> And <hi>George Caſſander,</hi> in his Conſultation addreſſed unto the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors,

                     <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Firſt, and <hi>Maximilian</hi> the Second; <q>The practice <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> of carrying publickly the Bread of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in publick pomp, and often to expoſe it unto the ſight of all the World, ſeemeth to have been introduced and received not very long ago, contrary unto the practice and intentions of the Ancients: for they had this Myſtery in ſo great veneration, that they ſuffered none ſo much as to ſee or receive it, but the Faithful, whom they eſteemed to be Members of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſuch as were worthy to partake of ſo great a Myſtery; therefore before Conſecration, the Catechumeny, the Poſſeſſed, the Penitents, and in a word, all thoſe which were not fit to receive, were by the voice of the Deacon commanded to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, and were turned out by the care of the Door-keepers. This practice therefore of thus carrying this Bread ought to be aboliſhed, without any prejudice unto the Church; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, it would receive great advantage thereby (provided the thing were prudently done) ſeeing it is but a late thing; and that without this Proceſſion, the honour of the Sacrament is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſſened, and may ſtill at this time be diſcontinued, ſeeing for the moſt part, this Ceremony ſeems rather for Pageantry and Shew, than for the peoples Devotion. By reaſon whereof <hi>(continues he) Albert Crantz,</hi> a man of very great Judgment, doth commend in his <hi>Metropolis, Nicholas de Cuſa,</hi> Legat in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> to have taken away the abuſe which was committed in too often carrying about the Sacrament of the Euchariſt in Proceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion upon Holy Days; and commanded that it ſhould not be carried out in publick, but betwixt the <hi>Octave</hi> of the Feaſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated unto the Sacrament: And <hi>Albert</hi> adds a memorable rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for it; <hi>Becauſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Heavenly Maſter inſtituted this Sacrament for Uſe, and not for Oſtentation.</hi> And as for the Feaſt it ſelf, it is certain it was inſtituted by <hi>Urban;</hi> not to carry the Sacrament in Proceſſion, but to make the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly the greater; and to the end Men ſhould ſo well prepare
<pb n="583" facs="tcp:47504:294"/>themſelves by works of Piety, that they might on that day par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of this precious Sacrament, and receive it with reſpect; for it is what the words of the Decree do import; and if the Inſtitution were duly kept, I think there would be nothing ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd in it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſilence of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and the ancient Diſputes of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians againſt them, and of theirs againſt the Chriſtians, doth ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry much contribute unto the Illuſtration of the queſtion which we examine. We have ſeen in the 9th. Chapter of the ſecond part, that the Pagans as well as Hereticks, had a particular knowledge of all that was believed and practiſed in the Church; and that there was ſcarce one of our Myſteries but they oppoſed, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which they made not ſome oppoſition againſt Chriſtians. But they never diſputed againſt them upon the point of the Euchariſt; even not then it ſelf, when the holy Fathers reproached them of adoring things which might be ſtolen away, and which muſt be kept under Lock and Key; things which ſometimes was given in pawn. From whence ſeveral do infer, That the Adoration of the Sacrament was not practiſed amongſt theſe Chriſtians; there being no probability that the <hi>Gentiles</hi> would have ſpared them upon the Adoration of the Sacrament, which is ſubject unto all theſe inconveniences wherewith they charged their falſe Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. They farther obſerve,
<note place="margin">In octav. Orat. pro contra Graec.</note> That when <hi>Minutius Foelix</hi> and <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian,</hi> called it an impious and ridiculous thing to adore what one ſanctified; the former ſaid unto them, <hi>You adore the Ox with the</hi> Egyptians, <hi>and you eat him afterwards.</hi> And that <hi>Theodoret</hi> wrote,
<note place="margin">Minut. Foel. Ibid. Quaeſt. in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſ. 9.55.</note> 
                     <hi>That it is the greateſt folly in the World, to adore that which one eats.</hi> They obſerve, I ſay, that theſe Pagans would not have been with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a reply, had the Church at that time given unto the Sacrament the Soveraign Worſhip of Religion, ſeeing it had been very eaſie for them to have retorted back theſe ſhameful reproaches upon this Object of their Adoration; and to ſay unto them, that they had not juſtice to condemn them for that which they eat, ſeeing that Chriſtians did the very ſame thing: And becauſe they never reply'd this unto the Church, it is concluded, That the Church did not adore the Sacrament. And what doth the more confirm theſe People in this Opinion, is, That the Heathens of theſe times do not fail to reproach the Latins, That they do eat the God which they Worſhip, as hath been repreſented in the 9th Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the ſecond Part, above recited.</p>
                  <p>St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> eſtabliſheth this Maxim,
<note place="margin">Serm. 12. de Diverſ.</note> That the God which the Chriſtians Worſhip, cannot be ſhewed with pointing the Finger. <q>Do not diſpute with me I beſeech you <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> and do not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portune me in asking me, What is the God that I adore? for it is
<pb n="584" facs="tcp:47504:295"/>not an Idol towards which I may point my Finger and tell you, That is the God which I adore: Neither is it a Planet, nor a Star, nor the Sun, nor the Moon, that I may ſtretch out my hand towards Heaven and ſhew you, That is the God which I adore.</q> He alſo applies this Maxim particularly unto Jeſus Chriſt Incarnate:
<note place="margin">Serm. 74. de Diverſ. Serm. 120. de Diverſ.</note> 
                     <q>Whileſt <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> we are in this Body, we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Lord; and if it were called in queſtion or denied, and that we were asked, Where is your God? we are not able to ſhew him. Jeſus Chriſt is always with his Father, as to the preſence of his Glory, and of his Divinity; As to his bodily preſence, he is now above the Heavens, at the right hand of his Father;</q> but he is in all Chriſtians by a preſence of Faith. It is in this ſenſe that St. <hi>Cyril</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſaid,
<note place="margin">Catech. 14.</note> 
                     <q>He is now ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in regard of his Fleſh; but he is preſent in the midſt of us in Spirit.</q> The Proteſtants hence do draw this induction, that theſe Maxims are inconſiſtent with the Adoration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and that they cannot reaſonably be eſtabliſhed by perſons which make the Euchariſt an Object of Divine Adoration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it cannot be denied, but that the Sacrament is a viſible Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, which is apprehended by our ſenſes, and by conſequence, an Object which can be ſhewed with the Finger; and of which it may be ſaid, See there the God which I adore.</p>
                  <p>They alſo pretend that the Holy Fathers Diſputes againſt the <hi>Ebionites,</hi> and the <hi>Docetes,</hi> two Sects of Hereticks: the former of which ſaid, That Jeſus Chriſt was but a meer Man; The others, That he had only a ſhadow of a Body: They pretend, I ſay, that the ſilence of the Fathers, upon the ſubject of the Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Sacraments in diſputing againſt theſe Hereticks, is an evident proof that it was not adored in the Ancient Church; becauſe, if it had been adored, they would have urged this Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration both againſt the one and the other: becauſe one adores not the Body of a common Man, nor an imaginary Body, and which hath nothing of a true Body, but a deceitful appearance. It is alſo what is farther inferred by ſome amongſt them, from the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſame Fathers in their Diſputes againſt the <hi>Aquarians,</hi> which celebrated the Euchariſt with Water only; ſaying, They could not diſpence themſelves from alledging this act of Adora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; to repreſent unto them, that the Conſecration not being to be performed with Water only, they would be guilty of the crime of Idolatry, to adore common Water as if it had been the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt, whatever intention they might have had other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe. They ſay the ſame of the Canon made by the third Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Braga, Anno</hi> 675. againſt thoſe which Conſecrated Milk inſtead of Wine in the Holy Cup; the Fathers ſatisfying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="585" facs="tcp:47504:295"/>in ſaying, that the Inſtitution of our Lord admitted not to celebrate with Milk; nevertheleſs, ſay the Proteſtants, if the Church had practiſed the Adoration of the Euchariſt, had not that been the fit time to have ſpoken of it; and to have ſhewed, That thoſe which did celebrate the Sacrament with Milk, cauſed the Church to be guilty of Idolatry; becauſe the People adoring the Cup, could not, in effect, adore any thing but Milk. How comes it to paſs, ſay they again, that this publick Service of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, this Adoration of the Sacrament, was never alledged to overthrow <hi>Neſtorias;</hi> who ſaid, in ſpeaking of the Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>That he could not adore him which had been an Infant of two Months old, and which had ſucked the Breaſts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the Greek Church, I cannot tell how (after all that hath been ſaid at the end of the XII. Chapter of the Second Part) it can be thought the Greeks adore the Sacrament. It is true, that all things which we therein obſerved, do not well agree, as many ſay, with this act of Adoration, no more than the reproach made by <hi>Arcudius</hi> (a Greek Latiniſed) againſt the Greeks; whereof we made mention in the ſame place: when he ſaith, <hi>That they give but little or no honour unto the Sacrament.</hi> As for <hi>Cabaſilas,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Theſſalonica,</hi> who wrote in the XIV. Century, he ſaith only, <hi>That believers, willing to ſhew their Devotion and their Faith, adore, bleſs, and celebrate as God,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>in the Act of communicating Jeſus Chriſt; who is underſtood in his gifts.</hi> Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, certain words of <hi>Gabriel</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> are cited; who was a Prelate at <hi>Venice</hi> about 45 years ago, the which do formally lay down the Adoration we treat of. But the Proteſtants anſwer thereunto, that beſides that, the Greeks do ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things which (as hath been ſhewed) agree not with this Ado<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. There never hath been in the Greek Church any Decree made for the adoring of the Euchariſt; neither doth there appear any, in their publick Books of Religion. They ſay moreover, That there is no certainty that the words cited under the name of <hi>Gabriel</hi> of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> are his; becauſe the Greek hath never been cited: And that if it were true that they had been ſpoke by this Prelate, it were not to be thought ſtrange, that a Greek, living amongſt the Latins, ſhould be prevailed upon by the ordinary pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of thoſe which adore the Sacrament with the Worſhip of Latry; but that his example and teſtimony conclude nothing touching the body of the Greek Church. In fine, <hi>Anthony Cancus,</hi> a Patrician of <hi>Venice,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Corfou,</hi> anſwering unto Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the XIII. which had commanded him particularly to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him of the differences betwixt the Greek and Latin Church, obſerves expreſly in his Hiſtory of the Hereſies of the Modern
<pb n="586" facs="tcp:47504:296"/>Greeks, the Manuſcript whereof is to be ſeen in the Kings Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brary, that there is no Chriſtian Communion which renders leſs reverence, leſs honour, nor leſs Worſhip unto the Sacrament of the Euchariſt, than the Greeks do. He alſo adds, that having taxed them with the little reſpect they give unto the Sacrament, that they anſwered him, That there was no command which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired this Adoration. From whence he takes occaſion to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare them unto <hi>Oecolampadius;</hi> who plainly taught, that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould not be adored with the Worſhip of Latry: Let the Reader judge of this diſpute; for it is not my buſineſs to decide it.</p>
                  <p>Therefore from the conſideration of the Greek Church, I paſs unto that of <hi>Ethiopia,</hi> or the <hi>Abyſſins;</hi> in the which, according to the teſtimony of <hi>Francis Alvarez</hi> a Prieſt of <hi>Portugal,</hi> and an Eye-witneſs,
<note place="margin">In his Voyage into Fthiopia, cap. 11.</note> all the People as well Men as Women, go unto the Communion with their hands lift up and open; and during the whole Office, and all the time of the Communion, every one is ſtanding;
<note place="margin">Damian a Goes, p. 507.</note> the which is confirmed by <hi>Zaga Zabo</hi> an <hi>Abyſſin,</hi> who in the Explication of their Faith, tranſlated by <hi>Damian Goes,</hi> obſerves, that in ſaying their Maſs, they do not ſhew the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Euchariſt, as he ſaw that it was uſually practiſed amongſt the Latins. The which doth ſhew how little credit is to be given unto a Liturgy of the <hi>Abyſſins</hi> which is put into Latin, in the Library of the Holy Fathers, without menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oning from whence it was taken, or who it is that tranſlated it; and in the which there is mention made both of the Elevation and Adoration of the Sacrament; the which is directly contrary unto the Depoſition of theſe two infallible Witneſſes; whoſe teſtimonies we juſt now received; and the one of which, to wit, <hi>Alvarez,</hi> expreſly obſerves, that the <hi>Abyſſins</hi> do not lift up the Sacrament in the Celebration of their Euchariſt; which is the cauſe, as the other ſaith, that the Sacrament is not ſhewed unto the People, as it is amongſt the Latins. And in the Weſt it ſelf, there hath always been People which have celebrated the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without adoring or lifting it up, as we have ſhewed at large in the firſt Part of this Hiſtorical Treatiſe; becauſe, before the Introduction of the Elevation, or Adoration of it in the Latin Church, <hi>Berengarius,</hi> with his followers, were grown very emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; who were immediately followed by the <hi>Albigenſis</hi> and <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſis,</hi> which ſpread themſelves in <hi>France, Italy, England,</hi> in <hi>Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia</hi> and elſewhere; and all thoſe celebrated the Euchariſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out lifting up or adoring the Sacrament; which practice was fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the <hi>Taborites</hi> of <hi>Bohemia,</hi> at the beginning of the XV. Century, and the which is alſo practiſed by Proteſtants, which are in very great numbers in all parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>

                  <p>In fine, to conclude this Chapter, and at the ſame time the whole Hiſtory of the Euchariſt, I will here inſert two paſſages of St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> to the end the Reader might judge of his Opinion touching the ſubject which we examine. In the firſt, he puts the Sacrament in the ſame degree with the other Symbols, and gives it only the reſpect which ought to be given unto Religious things,
<note place="margin">Lib. 3. de Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit. c. 10.</note> 
                     <q>To eſtabliſh a Sign, <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> one employs ſometimes a thing that was exiſtent before upon Earth; as <hi>Jacob</hi> when he awaked after his Dream, made uſe of the Stone which ſerved him for a Pillow while he ſlept; ſometimes the thing one makes uſe of, is made on purpoſe for it, and ſhould continue for ſome time after; as the Brazen Serpent which <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up in the Wilderneſs, and as our Characters and our Letters. But ſometimes alſo it ought to ceaſe to be, after having ſerved the uſe whereunto it was deſtinated; as the Bread which we make on purpoſe to that end, and which is conſumed in receiving of the Sacrament. But becauſe theſe things being done by Men, are known unto Men, they may be honoured or reſpected as Religious things, but to cauſe admiration as miraculous things, it is what they cannot do.</q> In the other of theſe two paſſages, he ſpeaks of Baptiſm, and of the Lords Supper, and without making any difference betwixt the one and the other, as to the reſpect which we owe them: He attributes unto them only a bare and common veneration; and alſo he will have us give it unto them, not through any carnal ſervitude, but by a ſpiritual liberty; that is to ſay, as he explains himſelf, not in venerating theſe Sacraments for their own ſake, nor in taking the Sign for the thing ſignified; but in directing our Devotion unto the things whereunto they do relate. <q>Him <hi>(ſaith he)</hi> that doth Worſhip or Venerate a Sign,

Chriſtian. cap. 8. &amp; 9.</note> without knowing what it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, he is made ſubject to the Law; but he that celebrates a Sign which is uſeful, and Divinely inſtituted, in knowing what it doth ſignifie, he doth not venerate that which is viſible and temporal: but all his Devotion is lifted up unto him unto whom it ought to be referred. And I affirm, that ſuch a perſon is free and ſpiritual, even though he had lived under the times of Bondage, wherein it was not yet convenient to explain the Signs unto carnal Men, they being to be brought under by this yoke. The Patriarchs and Prophets, and all thoſe of the Ancient <hi>Iſrael</hi> which the Holy Ghoſt made uſe of, were thoſe ſpiritual Men, whereby we have received the aid and comfort of the holy Scriptures. But ſince the Reſurrection of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, in theſe times wherein the Enſign of our liberty hath manifeſtly appeared, we are not ſo much as burdened with the troubleſome obſervation of Signs, whereof we have the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="588" facs="tcp:47504:297"/>already. Whereas the Ancients had ſuch great numbers, we have but very few, and theſe few it ſelf, which our Saviour and the example of the Apoſtles left us, are very eaſily practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, very eaſily underſtood, and of a moſt pure obſervation; as the Sacrament of Baptiſm, and the Celebration of the Body and Blood of our Saviour. Every one that receives them, knoweth them very well, and whereunto they have relation; and they be venerated, not by any carnal Obedience, but by a ſpiritual Liberty. Beſides, as it is the Nature of a ſervile weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to follow the literal ſenſe, and to take the Signs for the things ſignified. I ſuppoſe, that it is alſo the Nature of Error and Extravagancy, to attribute unto Signs needleſs and frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Explications.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>God Almighty give us all Grace ſo well to diſtinguiſh Signs, from the things which they repreſent, that we may never give unto thoſe, that which we ought only to render unto theſe; I mean, that Jeſus Chriſt only may be the Object of our Worſhip and Adoration; and his Sacraments, that of our Veneration and Reſpect. So be it. <hi>Amen.</hi>
